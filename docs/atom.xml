    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, we talked about the best<a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/android/best-offline-games-for-android/" target="_blank" rel="external">offline games</a>for Android. We are aware that the listed<a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/vpn/best-gaming-vpn/" target="_blank" rel="external">games</a>were supported on both iOS and Android. In fact, we have yet to come across<a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/android/best-shooter-games-for-android/" target="_blank" rel="external">Android</a>exclusive titles. So that opens a discussion about all the games that have come out on iOS that are playable offline. However, we recommend you check out our Android list after you’re done with this, it lists exceptional offline<a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/android/the-best-android-games-of-2017/" target="_blank" rel="external">games</a>that came out on iOS first and are definitely worth checking out. Here’s our list for the best offline games for iOS that are a one-time purchase.</p>
<h3 id="1-Device-6"><a href="#1-Device-6" class="headerlink" title="1. Device 6"></a>1.

<p>If you remember the choose your own adventure genre of books, Device 6 will seem familiar to you. Since page turning on a tablet is purely an affectation, the multiple award winning (including the coveted Apple Design Award) Device 6 takes it to the next conclusion. The game is a story about solving puzzles and finding your way through a series of choices. Some of those choices will lead to dead-ends and some of those choices will make the story progress.</p>
<p>Each new arc will either ask you to change your device’s orientation to read further, or will require you to scroll back to pick up sounds or other clues. There are no loading screens, no need for saves, it is a linear game with branching arcs. This is a must have for all iOS owners, even if they are not gamers, because it is a first of its kind genre defining game.</p>

<p>This is the game that took Telltale series form an obscure developer to a mainstream medium for title crossovers. Even though their preliminary focus remains on comic and fantasy crossovers today, their biggest foray was bringing back Monkey Island for the modern generation. The episodic concept was not even mainstream at the time. Telltale told the story of Guybrush Threepwood attempting to save himself from becoming a Zombie while protecting his wife Elaine Marley from the zombie pirate LeChuck. The last sequel of this series came out in the year 2000. If you are not familiar with the property, it is a comedy game (and a hilarious one at that) that focuses on puzzle solving to get through. Highly recommended.</p>

<p>This is one of those Tim Shafer strokes of genius. It originally came out on DOS back in 1993 as a sequel to Maniac Mansion that came out in 1987. In fact, you can even play the original game on an old computer. The remastered edition has breathed new life into what was already a timeless classic. The game is a comedy about a sentient tentacle who drinks radioactive water and becomes evil. Our main characters are a loony scientist who created the tentacle and three kids who end up in different eras in time.</p>
<p>You meet the founding fathers of the United States and you are thrust into a totalitarian future where the tentacles rule and humans are treated as pets. Day of The Tentacle is about restoring the timeline and order in the world. Every single puzzle is intriguing, the story is both engrossing and funny, and it is an experience every gamer needs to have at least once in their lives.</p>

<p>This first person adventure game comes from Simogo AB, the people behind Device 6. The game takes the Swedish lore of timewalking and turns it into the core mechanic. Set in the 19th century, the game relies on you to solve puzzles by touching them and seeing a glimpse of the future. The storyline is very immersive and you will be lost in all the creepy detail and atmosphere. The game, much like Device 6, is a bold step that seems to have paid off. It is a fantastic looking game that is both fun to play and immersive to experience.</p>

<p>The success of Minecraft is extraordinary. With a constantly expanding canvas that has now grown larger in size than the planet Neptune, it attracts players from all over the world to build structures out of blocks. If you are not familiar with the property, it is like playing with LEGOs on a computer, with the caveat that you never run out of blocks and you can do practically anything you want. People have recreated entire cities accurately scaled to the last detail, people have created bots (called engineers) to help create large structures for them. Even companies like Verizon have created cell networks within the game, where you can browse the internet and even make video calls (which is a feat of computer engineering on its own, check that out<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdlZRhKmWJY&amp;ab_channel=CaptainSparklez" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>).</p>
<p>If you are interested in creating objects, then this THE game for you. The pocket edition lets you play the game using the touchscreen and gives you the same access as any other platform.</p>

<p>This game originally came out in 1999 and has become a signature series since. Originally it was published by 3DO, now by Ubisoft (They’re up to the VII installment now). It is a turn based strategy game that puts you in the fictional world of fantasy creatures. You choose between mythical factions to strategically wage war against others. An army sent from the divine heavens could be put to fight against the armies of hell. Or you could pit orcs and goblins against elves and dragons. Genies vs Vampires, the list goes on.</p>

<p>The game is a turn-based strategy game. You send a hero out into the world to explore, fight creatures, unearth hidden and protected treasures, and defeat other heroes to become the last player standing. There is a fantastic story mode that takes you to all the realms in the game and a hot seat multiplayer mode that lets as many as 8 players take turns on the same machine. The HD remake keeps all the elements of the original release, only with updated visuals. The original game is played completely using a mouse pointer, which makes touch the ideal evolutionary platform for it.</p>

<p>You are a prisoner in a maximum security facility. Your mission is to escape. You do so by first learning the prison routine. You then craft items that will eventually help you find your way out of the prison. The concept is very simple, yet also very intriguing. It borrows numerous parts of different games like Minecraft and stealth games and combines them to help you escape from the confines of prison.</p>

<p>The LEGO series of games is a widespread genre from simple construction games to complex storylines with mainstream characters. There are crossovers from DC, Marvel, Star Wars, Harry Potter, and numerous others. The games bring a new light to already established properties. There is a fantastic storyline exclusive to the LEGO World. You can replay your favourite moments from franchises like Harry Potter and Star Wars with a LEGO twist, you can patrol Metropolis as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman or Green Lantern, it’s all possible. On top of all that, the games are genuinely fun without being silly. There is campy humor sprinkled here and there, but the games themselves are very true to the source material.</p>

<h3 id="9-Oceanhorn-–-Monster-of-Uncharted-Seas"><a href="#9-Oceanhorn-–-Monster-of-Uncharted-Seas" class="headerlink" title="9. Oceanhorn – Monster of Uncharted Seas"></a>9. Oceanhorn – Monster of Uncharted Seas</h3><p>Oceanhorn, by the developer’s own admission, is the iOS equivalent of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild the insanely popular title by Nintendo making the rounds on Nintendo Switch and Wii devices. However, Oceanhorn isn’t a cheap attempt at capitalizing on another title’s success, it is thematically close to The Wind Walker.</p>
<p>It is a beautifully crafted game with extremely stunning visuals that truly milk the GPU in your iOS device (especially the iPhone 7/7 Plus). The story is well crafted, the sound is well designed. It is actually a good game on its own merits and should definitely be tried out especially if you are a fan of the Zelda games.</p>

<p>This game will remind of you Lara Craft Go at first glance, because of the eerily similar visuals. However, if you treat it as a standalone title, you will be pleasantly surprised at just how good this game is. The game focuses on both visuals and some interesting puzzles to solve. Games like these are fun to play, as they can be played any time without requiring too much attention while still being entertaining.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Mac App Store and the iTunes App Store both ask for your password when you download an app. You will be asked to enter your Apple ID password regardless if you’re buying an app or downloading a free one. This is done in part to prevent unauthorized purchases. It’s also a good deterrent for when the kids go wild on the App Store. The only problem is that it can get annoying. If you don’t want to enter your password for free app downloads, you can save it. Likewise, if you’re regretting this decision, you can remove your Apple ID password for free purchases. Here’s how you can store or remove your Apple ID password for free purchases in macOS.</p>
<h3 id="Store-Apple-ID-Password-For-Free-Purchases"><a href="#Store-Apple-ID-Password-For-Free-Purchases" class="headerlink" title="Store Apple ID Password For Free Purchases"></a>Store Apple ID Password For Free Purchases</h3><p>There are two ways to go about this. One, open the Mac App Store app and look for a free app. Click the ‘Get’ button and enter your Apple ID password when prompted.</p>
<p>The Mac App Store app will prompt you to save your password for future free purchases. It’s very much like your browser asking to store login credentials for a website.</p>
<p>When you see the ‘Save Password for Free Items’ prompt, click ‘Yes’.</p>

<p>If the prompt doesn’t appear, you can use the second method.</p>
<p>Open the System Preferences app. Click the App Store preference. At the very bottom is an option called ‘Free Downloads’. Open the drop-down next to it and select ‘Save Password’. macOS might prompt you to enter your Apple ID password. This will not affect paid app downloads. You will still be asked to enter your password when you buy an app.</p>

<h3 id="Remove-Apple-ID-Password-For-Free-Purchases"><a href="#Remove-Apple-ID-Password-For-Free-Purchases" class="headerlink" title="Remove Apple ID Password For Free Purchases"></a>Remove Apple ID Password For Free Purchases</h3><p>Open System Preferences and select ‘App Store’. At the bottom of this preference pane open the Free Downloads drop-down. Select the ‘Require Password’ option. The next time you download a free app from the Mac App Store, you will have to enter you Apple ID password.</p>

<p>This option has its pros and cons. The pro here is that you don’t need to verify your identity when you download a free app. A free app, by and large, will not create a problem for you. The con is that even free apps can be problematic in terms of content. If you don’t want to save your Apple ID password for free apps to protect minors who might use your Mac, consider using parental controls instead of removing your Apple ID password.</p>

    <title>How To Open Recently Quit Apps On macOS</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On macOS, closing an app and quitting it are two different things. When you close an app, you close all its windows. When you quit an app, you exit it. The difference is a closed app is technically still running. If you open it again, it will open much faster. Some apps don’t differentiate between closing and quitting. If you close an app, you effectively quit it at the same time.<strong>App Be Back</strong>is a free macOS app that lets you open recently quit apps via a keyboard shortcut. If you recently quit multiple apps, you can re-open them all again in reverse order. App Be Back is like the undo-close for recently closed tabs in your browse, except it works for apps.</p>
<p>Download and run App Be Back. You can undo-quit or open recently quit apps on macOS for all apps you quit after running App Be Back. If you quit an app when App Be Back wasn’t running, it will not be able to re-open it. The app works via a keyboard shortcut, and its menu bar icon.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/mac-os/open-recently-quit-apps/attachment/app-be-back/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://cloud.addictivetips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/app-be-back.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>To open recently quit apps, simply tap the Shift+Command+W keyboard shortcut. This will open the<a href="https://www.addictivetips.com/mac-os/how-to-switch-between-recent-apps-using-the-touch-bar-in-macos/" target="_blank" rel="external">recent app</a>you just quit. If you tap the shortcut again, it will open the app you quit before that last app.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/mac-os/open-recently-quit-apps/attachment/app-be-back-undo-quit/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://cloud.addictivetips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/app-be-back-undo-quit.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>For example, if you quit Safari, Photos, and Calendar in that order, the first time you tap the Shift+Command+W shortcut, it will open the Calendar app. If you tap it a second time, it will open Photos. Tapping it a third time will open Safari.</p>

<p>You can set App Be Back to open at login. You can also customize its shortcut to anything you like. To customize the app’s shortcut, and clear its history, click the app icon in the menu bar.</p>
<p>From the app menu, select ‘Change Keyboard Shortcut’ to record your own shortcut for the app. Select ‘Clear History’ to clear the history of recently closed apps. If you want to set it so that App Be Back runs at login, select ‘Show Intro’ from the app’s menu bar menu. The intro screen has a launch at login option.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/mac-os/open-recently-quit-apps/attachment/app-be-back-preferences/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://cloud.addictivetips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/app-be-back-preferences.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>App Be Back is a pretty neat app to have running. The only thing missing is perhaps an option to hide the app’s menu bar icon. It works perfectly well with just the keyboard shortcut and the menu bar icon is seldom needed. You might need it to change the app’s keyboard shortcut but that’s not a recurring need.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google Assistant is Google’s answer to Siri, or Cortana. Google Assistant is the company’s attempt at a virtual assistant app. Unlike Apple though, Google isn’t restricting it to just Android. There’s already a Google Assistant iOS app which is limited compared to its Android counterpart but it’s there. You won’t see a Siri app for Android any time soon. While Google has made the Google Assistant app available on iOS of its own volition, it hasn’t released a desktop app for it. This is why you can’t get Google Assistant on macOS or Windows the same way you can get Siri and Cortana respectively.</p>
<p>The good news is, the developer community is on it.<strong>MacAssistant</strong>is a free open-source Mac app that lets you use Google Assistant on macOS. The app is still in beta but it works reasonably well.</p>
<p>Download MacAssistant. The developer isn’t verified so if you’re running the latest version of macOS, you won’t be able to run the app by just double-clicking it. Instead, open it Finder. Hold down the Ctrl key and then click the app. Select ‘Open’ from the context menu and the app will open.</p>

<p>MacAssistant runs from the Menu bar. Click the app icon in the Menu bar and sign in to your Google account.</p>

<p>We should warn you now that this app will have broad control over your Google account. It’s not something to worry about given the app is open source.</p>
<p>After you sign in, click the Menu bar button again. In the pop-up that opens, click the mic button and<a href="https://www.addictivetips.com/android/get-google-assistant-android-phone/" target="_blank" rel="external">Google Assistant</a>will ‘listen’ for your command. You don’t need to give the app additional access to your mic as it already has access to it.</p>

<p>Commands at present are limited but you can ask it general questions like what the weather’s like outside.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/mac-os/get-google-assistant-on-macos/attachment/google-assistant-2/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://cloud.addictivetips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/google-assistant-1.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The answer to whatever you ask Google Assistant is spoken back to you. There’s no UI for it just now. If you have the volume turned down, you won’t be able to use MacAssistant in its present form.</p>
<p>Like the earlier versions of Google Assistant, MacAssistant works only with voice input. Unlike the app on Android which now lets you<a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/android/input-text-in-google-assistant/" target="_blank" rel="external">input text in Google Assistant</a>, MacAssistant works only with voice commands. The app is still in its infancy so while we may have a wishlist of features, it’s not really fair to bring it up considering the app’s only been around for a week. It’s in active development so you can expect it to improve exponentially.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple released macOS Sierra in 2016 and the major feature in this version was the inclusion of Siri on the desktop. Plenty of other smaller features were also part of the update but Siri on the desktop was something people had been anticipating for quite some time. Another major update from Apple came in the form of the new Macbooks which have a new hardware component called the Touch Bar. It has mixed reviews but developers have been hard a work adding support for the Touch Bar. Here are the 10 best macOS apps and tips of 2016.</p>

<p>Designs and drawings by Raymond Loewy who designed the Air Force One logo, the Coca-Cola bottle, the Shell Oil logo, the US Postal Service logo, and the Greyhound logo.</p>
<p>Why not learn from the best design experts with the most impressive track record? Raymond Loewy (1893-1986) is often referred to as the father of Industrial Design and his track record is indeed impressive. The Air Force One logo, the Coca-Cola bottle, the Shell Oil logo, the US Postal Service logo, the Greyhound logo are just some of his impressive designs which still exist today.</p>
<p>Today, Loewy can still teach us to design our products with just the rightbalance between the well-known present, on onehand, and a new and innovative future on the other hand. If we don’t hit the right balance, our users won’t embrace nor buy our products, Loewy emphasized.</p>
<h2 id="The-MAYA-Principle"><a href="#The-MAYA-Principle" class="headerlink" title="The MAYA Principle"></a>The MAYA Principle</h2><p>Loewy’s secret was essential to design for the future – but delivering the future gradually. He designed his famous logos, some of the most recognizable cars of the 40s, 50s, and 60s, refrigerators, and locomotives for his users’ present needs and skills while pushing the boundaries of design and technology beyond his users’expectations. He called this approach the MAYA principle. Maya is an abbreviation for“<strong>Most Advanced. Yet Acceptable.</strong>” which means that Loewy sought to give his users the most advanced design, but not more advanced than what they were able to accept and embrace. Loewy believed that:</p>
<p>“The adult public’s taste is not necessarily ready to accept the logical solutions to their requirements if the solution implies too vast a departure from what they have been conditioned into accepting as the norm.”</p>

<p>The early iPod is a good example of how Apple applied the MAYA principle. The iPod’s designers gradually pushed theproduct design further and further as the iPod gradually lost the extra buttons and got a more streamlined interface. It is very likely that this gradual development from the first iPod in 2001 was what made the iPhone acceptable to users when it was launched in 2007. By applying the MAYA principle, the designers at Apple provided the users with the most advanced design within the boundaries of their acceptance.</p>

<p>The Newton tablet was an early personal digital assistant and the first tablet platform developed by Apple. Apple started developing the tablet in 1987. It was launched in 1993 and cancelled in 1998 as it was a financial disaster for Apple. There were several reasons that the Newton tablet did not become a success, but one of the main reasons could well be that the Newton tablet was introduced without users being familiar with a digital personal assistant.</p>
<p>A more recent example is Google Glass which has not become the success it was anticipated to become. Maybe it’s because the whole concept of wearing glasses that both record everything we do – while augmenting what we see with a layer of information – is simply too advanced for us. Maybe we need to take gradual steps before being ready to embrace this new technology. So the question is, how do we learn to strike the right balance between the most advanced design and our users’ ability to accept our product?</p>

<p>The lack of success for both Apple’s Newton tablet and Google Glass could be that they were too advanced for their users.</p>
<h2 id="How-You-Can-Apply-the-MAYA-Principle-in-Your-Everyday-Design-Work"><a href="#How-You-Can-Apply-the-MAYA-Principle-in-Your-Everyday-Design-Work" class="headerlink" title="How You Can Apply the MAYA Principle in Your Everyday Design Work"></a>How You Can Apply the MAYA Principle in Your Everyday Design Work</h2><p>Most of us have experienced the frustrating feeling of trying to explain and sell a great design solution and not get the buy-in from our management or clients. Maybe the design solution was too advanced? Or too much like the old design? Next time, you should consider using the MAYA principle to strike the right balance.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advance your design gradually over time</strong><br>as the Apple designers did with their development of the iPod. Do not make a lot of major changes right away as you risk scaring off your users. You need to ask yourself what context your users are familiar with and which features has to be changed. When in doubt you should distinguish between: Nice to have and need to have.</li>
<li><strong>Include familiar patterns in the visual design</strong><br>so users can orient themselves just like Apple’s designers gradually made the iPod more and more streamlined and eventually launched the ultra-streamlined iPhone.</li>
<li><strong>Draw on your user’s present skills and mindset</strong><br>while presenting them with only a carefully chosen few major changes.</li>
<li>A golden rule is that<br><strong>if you have to explain your product design</strong><br>and if you need to include a manual or elaborate “help” features, your product is overly advanced or too complex to use. Your users should be able to understand and use your product instantly or at least with little training and explanation. Your users will lose confidence in the product and in themselves if they need to read a thick manual to understand it. We will explain how to find the right balance further down based on the theory of psychologist Lev Vygotsky.</li>
<li><p>The MAYA principle resonates with many design principles and heuristics such as the “<br>Match between the system and the real world” from Jakob Nielsen’s list of heuristics (</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heur…</a><br><strong>).</strong></p>
</li>
<li>The MAYA principle<br>also resonates with the use of libraries and design patterns when designing interactions: By using standard libraries and design patterns, you can increase the level of familiarity that the users will have with your design. That can be helpful if you aim to push the boundaries in some aspects of your design, i.e. if you intentionally depart from the norm in some aspects of your design.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Psychological-and-Philosophical-Perspectives-by-Vygotsky-and-Kierkegaard"><a href="#Psychological-and-Philosophical-Perspectives-by-Vygotsky-and-Kierkegaard" class="headerlink" title="Psychological and Philosophical Perspectives by Vygotsky and Kierkegaard"></a>Psychological and Philosophical Perspectives by Vygotsky and Kierkegaard</h2><p>“Most Acceptable, Yet Advanced” is not specific to design. It’s fundamental to how human beings learn new skills and insights.</p>
<p>Among educators, the Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard (1813-1855) is often quoted for emphasizing the fact that when you want to help someone learn a new skill (or product), you first need to find out about the person’s present skill level. You need to find out what’s acceptable to them before teaching them anything new and advanced. Otherwise your efforts (and your design of a new product) will not be worth anything. For instance, there is no reason to teach a child to spell the word “philosophical” if the child has not learned what an alphabet is and what it means. The first step is always to find out what is “acceptable” for the learner and user.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.interaction-design.org/images/ux-daily/cec01630870857ba3b5a639a1429fb16.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>There’s no need to teach a child to spell the word “philosophical” if the child has not learned what an alphabet is and what it means. The first step is always to find out what is “acceptable” for the learner and user.</p>
<p>How advanced and innovative can you then make your new product or design? To answer that question, you can use the principle called the<strong>zone of proximal development (ZPD).</strong>The term was developed by the Soviet psychologist and founder of cultural-historical psychology, Lev Semyonovich Vygotsky (1896-1934).Vygotsky’s term zone of proximal development describes the range of skills that a child is in the process of learning.</p>
<p>Vygotsky stated that a child follows an adult’s example and gradually develops the ability to do certain tasks without help. Vygotsky believed that the role of education is to give children experiences that are within their zones of proximal development, thereby encouraging and advancing their individual learning.We will tell you how you can use that in a design process, but first you need some more background on the ZPD.</p>
<p>The lower limit of the ZPDis the maximum level of skill which a child can acquire by working independently (the child’s actual developmental level). This can be compared to your users’ present level of skills and the skills they are (easily) able to learn by themselves. This would mean small changes in an existing product, or a new product with a strong similarity to existing products or interaction patterns.</p>
<p>The upper limit of the ZPDis the maximum level of skills that the child is able to reach with the assistance of a more capable instructor. Vygotsky emphasized that you can only help the child, i.e. your user, through gradual steps of evolving new skills and understandings. A first-grade teacher will, of course, know that a child will learn to spell even the most complex words in the future. But you don’t present the child with long complex words to begin with. You start gradually by presenting the child with the letter A, then the letter B, and so forth. You always have to aim for only the next reachable zone of development.</p>
<p>What you can learn from Vygotsky is that you have to distinguish between:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your user’s lower limit of ZPD – i.e. what she can easily learn by herself, without your help, without a manual, or without an instructor’s help.</li>
<li>Your user’s upper limit of ZPD – i.e. what she can learn with the help of an instructor or manual.</li>
</ul>
<p>When seeking the right balance you should remember that a child most often has to attend school. Your users don’t have to buy your product. Maybe some users are forced to use your products at work, but you should strongly consider if you design for the lower or upper limit of ZPD. Do you want your users to read manuals or to require instruction before being able to use your product, or do you want them to be able to easily teach themselves new functions?</p>
<p>The MAYA principle advocates for designing with the lower limit of ZPD in mind if you want your product to succeed. Most often, users will not spend their valuable time and money by learning how to use your new product if they can find a product which is easier to use.At the same time, users are often attracted to shiny new products with advanced features - designed with the future in mind. Finding the right balance could be the determining factor that will decide if your next product will become a success.</p>

    <title>Web Design Usability Tips For Billing Forms</title>

    <updated>2017-06-14T03:43:53.575Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Each ecommerce site has its owncheckout flowmoving the user from a shopping cart to the final purchase. This differs based on what the user is buying and their intentions, but finalizing payment is always the toughest part.</p>
<p>Your<strong>billing fields</strong>need to really keep visitors engaged and encourage them to complete the checkout process. I’d like to share some usability tips you can follow to improve yourbilling form designs and increase user checkout conversions.</p>
<h2 id="Clarify-Intent"><a href="#Clarify-Intent" class="headerlink" title="Clarify Intent"></a>Clarify Intent</h2><p>Your goal is to design forms that encourage users to buy. So you want to make this process as simple as possible, especially at the billing phase where money is on the line.</p>
<p>There is no single way to clarify an entire billing form. You just need to keep each field clear and concise, never let the user feel confused or unsure of their decision to check out.</p>
<p>Here are some techniques you should keep in mind that work well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Larger typography</li>
<li>Labels instead of placeholders(or both)</li>
<li>Extra padding between fields</li>
<li>Custom<br><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/tabindex" target="_blank" rel="external">tabindex</a><br> for easier navigation</li>
</ul>
<p>Also add plenty of icons to demonstrate visuals where needed. The<a href="https://www.threadless.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Threadless checkout page</a>offers a great example.</p>
<p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/MBbAjyF.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>The credit card icons make it crystal clear what the user is selecting as a payment method. The same goes for icons lower in the field which clarify the location of CVV numbers.</p>
<p>Do everything in your power to let the user know exactly what they’re doing at each stage of the billing form. There should be no ambiguous terms, no unclear directions, and plenty of tooltips/icons to answer any questions along the way.</p>
<h2 id="Custom-Input-Spacing"><a href="#Custom-Input-Spacing" class="headerlink" title="Custom Input Spacing"></a>Custom Input Spacing</h2><p>Some data requires a certain text format like phone numbers and credit cards. This spacing can be dynamically generated on-the-fly using JavaScript and it’s one of the best techniques you can add to your website.</p>
<p>Custom spacing lets users know they’re on the right track when filling out form fields.</p>
<p>You can do this with zip codes where the form automatically tabs onto the next field once the user enters the proper digits for a zip code. Same with phone numbers where you can auto-style the digits to match a phone number. You can see this on eBay’s checkout form.</p>
<p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/JFZRNzf.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>But the most useful is the credit card 4-digit spacing format. Credit card numbers are long and they’re easy to screw up. An incorrect CC number also means the order will completely backfire.</p>
<p>This custom CC spacing in your billing field makes it that much easier for customers to enter their numbers and double-check that they’re correct. You can find a nice example on the<a href="https://www.bodybuilding.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">BodyBuilding checkout screen</a>which also includes error messages when you have an invalid entry.</p>
<p><img src="http://img1.tuicool.com/byumeaz.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>There are tons of free plugins you can use to create the auto-formatted text. Most run on jQuery but you can find some vanilla JS solutions too.</p>
<p>These are the best ones I’ve found:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jessepollak.github.io/card/" target="_blank" rel="external">Card.js</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wangjohn.github.io/creditly/" target="_blank" rel="external">Creditly.js</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/lopezton/jquery-creditcard-formatter" target="_blank" rel="external">jQuery Card Formatter</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Simplify-The-Action"><a href="#Simplify-The-Action" class="headerlink" title="Simplify The Action"></a>Simplify The Action</h2><p>Some checkout forms are longer than others so the process always feels different for every website. This can be confusing for many visitors and it’s one reason why ecommerce stalled for so long in the early 2000s.</p>
<p>But regardless of your form’s length there are two ways to design around this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Smaller forms should try to keep everything on one page for simplicity</li>
<li>Larger billing forms should break into steps with breadcrumbs</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the smaller billing form on SEMrush is fantastic. Very quick to use, easy to read and everything you need to know is clearly visible on the page.</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/Qf6Zz2Q.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>But I don’t mind a longer checkout process so long as it hasbreadcrumbs. These offer a clear indicator of how far the user has traveled into the checkout process and how much longer they have before completion.</p>
<p>This confidence makes it easier for someone to commit to the billing form at each step. If they have no idea when the checkout process ends they might get confused, anxious, or just annoyed and leave.</p>
<p>Breadcrumbs are huge and I absolutely recommend adding them to larger billing forms. The<a href="https://www.wiggle.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Wiggle</a>checkout uses clear breadcrumbs at the top of each form page.</p>
<p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/rUBJzuY.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>Smaller &amp; larger billing forms can work well just varying different techniques. Be willing to try both!</p>
<p>Run someA/B split testsand see which style performs better. You might be surprised at the results.</p>
<h2 id="Recap-The-Purchase"><a href="#Recap-The-Purchase" class="headerlink" title="Recap The Purchase"></a>Recap The Purchase</h2><p>Once the user enters their billing information it can be tough to hit that final “submit” button. Hesitation is the death of conversion.</p>
<p>By recapping the purchase order you give customers a final peace of mind. They can see everything at once from the items they’re purchasing to the total fees(plus processing) and even the delivery date if applicable.</p>
<p>GitHub’s pro upgrade billing field recaps the purchase all on one page. It clarifies how often you’ll be billed, what the final fee is, and when you can expect the next fee. Most fields are filled out from your profile so if you have an account this process is very quick.</p>
<p><img src="http://img1.tuicool.com/ZjeiMzN.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>Another example is Amazon, the mother of all ecommerce shops.</p>
<p>Once you enter all your details like shipping address &amp; payment info, one final screen recaps the whole order to make sure you really understand what you’re purchasing.</p>
<p>This reduces returns for wrong items and helps the customer feel confident when they press that “purchase” button.</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/FNrEnuq.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>Recapping the order can be tough on a smaller billing form. But just be<strong>openly transparent</strong>with your customers and share as much detail as possible.</p>
<h4 id="Wrapping-Up"><a href="#Wrapping-Up" class="headerlink" title="Wrapping Up"></a>Wrapping Up</h4><p>Your site’s billing form is the only thing standing between a potential customer and a paying customer. That’s whyform optimizationis so important.</p>
<p>I hope these trends can help you craft usable and encouraging billing forms that’ll bring more revenue to your shop and all of your clients. Optimization is an ongoing process but if you’re constantly testing new ideas you’ll always be ahead of the competition.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With conversion on mobile much lower then desktop, improving it is a priority for retailers.</p>
<p>How does your mobile conversion measure up?</p>
<h3 id="How-does-your-mobile-conversion-rate-stack-up-against-the-Mobile-Benchmark"><a href="#How-does-your-mobile-conversion-rate-stack-up-against-the-Mobile-Benchmark" class="headerlink" title="How does your mobile conversion rate stack up against the Mobile Benchmark?"></a>How does your mobile conversion rate stack up against the Mobile Benchmark?</h3><p>Finding out how your mobile conversion rates compare with the market average, and with a range of retailers, is the first step towards focused optimisation.</p>
<p>It’s no secret that conversion rates amongst customers using mobile devices is a real issue for retailers. The fact that mobile delivers roughly half the conversion rate of desktop is worry enough - but add shoppers’ growing preference for the mobile channel and it’s little wonder so many retailers now see mobile optimisation as a priority.</p>
<p>But where to start? That’s been the first question for almost all the retailers with whom we’ve worked on mobile optimisation over the last few months. They’ve known it’s a problem, but not how big a problem or where to begin tackling it.</p>
<h3 id="The-Mobile-Benchmark"><a href="#The-Mobile-Benchmark" class="headerlink" title="The Mobile Benchmark"></a>The Mobile Benchmark</h3><p>The first step has to be to understand the scale of the problem - to look at mobile conversion not in isolation, but in the kind of meaningful context that provides an answer the question:<em>“How big a problem is mobile conversion for this retailer?”</em></p>
<p>The work we’ve done in this area at Biglight has generated a huge amount of data around customer behaviour on mobile - and, as a result, we can benchmark performance in aggregate and in micro-conversions from arrival on the site through to checkout.</p>
<p>In this post, I want to look at the top level - the aggregate view. We call it the Mobile Benchmark. It’s a simple, quadrant-style graph that visualises mobile performance, when compared with other retailers and an overall average.</p>
<p>It looks like this (below), the two gold lines marking the average positions on each axis - 50% for the mobile traffic mix, and just over 45% for mobile conversion rate, as a percentage of desktop conversion rate:</p>
<p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/32EviqE.png!web" alt=""></p>
<p>This is real data, based on the UK performance of 15 leading retailers of apparel, footwear, homewares and accessories in March and April this year, but the method can be applied to almost any type of retailer. Just follow this simple formula and then plot the results on the same X and Y axes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Work out the Mobile Traffic Mix % (the X axis) - Mobile (smartphone) traffic divided by total traffic, multiplied by 100</li>
<li>Then work out the Relative Conversion Rate % for mobile (the Y axis) - Mobile Conversion % divided by Desktop Conversion %, multiplied by 100.</li>
</ol>
<p>By looking at relative conversion performance, we eliminate the variation in conversion between retailers for other reasons (such as overall proposition, availability etc), allowing us to focus on the performance of mobile in a relatively comparable context.</p>
<h3 id="Using-the-Mobile-Benchmark-How-big-is-the-opportunity"><a href="#Using-the-Mobile-Benchmark-How-big-is-the-opportunity" class="headerlink" title="Using the Mobile Benchmark: How big is the opportunity?"></a>Using the Mobile Benchmark: How big is the opportunity?</h3><p>In essence, this instantly highlights how big any retailer’s mobile optimisation opportunity is, and how urgently the process should begin.</p>
<p>For instance, a retailer that plots in the top left quadrant is in a relatively strong position - that position denotes a relatively low mobile mix, and a relatively high mobile conversion rate. That means, mobile users are a lower proportion of traffic than average and that those who visit the site using mobile deliver a better than average conversion rate, relative to desktop.</p>
<p>On the other hand, those that plot in the bottom right quadrant have a serious, and urgent problem (or the biggest potential opportunity). The combination of a high mobile mix with a low relative mobile conversion rate is not good news - lots of people are visiting by mobile, but they are not simply not converting.</p>
<p>Of course, those are the extremes. As the example above demonstrates though, most plot somewhere between the two, which shows that, for the vast majority of retailers, there remains a significant opportunity to improve mobile revenue performance.</p>
<p>We’ve noted over time that all data points tend to shift to the right (as mobile continues to displace both desktop and tablet as the users’ device of choice), but there is no evidence of any increase in relative conversion performance as this happens. In short, there is no correlation between an increase in the Mobile Traffic Mix and Relative Conversion Rate over time.</p>
<p>Where the Mobile Benchmark has proven most useful for our clients is in offering visual, empirical evidence of the issue, benchmarked against the market - the ability to share that across the business has proven very handy when scaling the opportunity (relative to both the average and maximum performance) and securing budget to get the mobile optimisation process going.</p>
<h3 id="Focused-mobile-optimisation-What-next"><a href="#Focused-mobile-optimisation-What-next" class="headerlink" title="Focused mobile optimisation: What next?"></a>Focused mobile optimisation: What next?</h3><p>The next step is to understand precisely where the issues are - which aspects of the mobile journey are simply not working and why.</p>
<p>That, again, starts with a benchmarking process; one that breaks the journey down into stages. We look at ‘Browse to Basket’ and ‘Basket to Conversion’ as two broad steps in the journey - then in more detail at micro-conversions (for instance the product detail page to product listing page micro-conversion), to identify the specific parts of the journey that present the biggest optimisation opportunities.</p>
<p>We then complete structured usability testing, focusing on those parts of the journey, along with other behavioural research, to identify the_why_behind the opportunities the data has revealed. That discipline, along with prototyping major changes, A/B testing and rapid deployment, are the final steps towards delivering a step-change in mobile revenue performance.</p>
<p>I’ll cover those steps in the process in more detail in my next post. In the meantime, why not take the challenge?</p>
<p>Plot your own mobile performance on the Mobile Benchmark and let us know how you get on.</p>

<p>Rebranding is an incredible challenge for any company, and the uniqueness of the task guarantees there will always be new things to learn. You might say that some of the lessons are well-known, but how they apply – and how they impact you – can offer refreshing insight.</p>
<p>As a company president who is currently leading an organization through a rebrand, I’m hoping to pass on a few tips for how entrepreneurs, businessleadersand managers can navigate similar waters without fear of capsizing.</p>

<p>The company, which was founded with the name Allied Trade Group, started as several websites that all rolled in to the same business, originally branded as ATGStores.com. But, as the home furnishings industry changed, it became clear to us that “ATG” would have to change, too. Here are 10 things we learned in becoming The Mine – now a premier online destination for unique fine furnishings and décor.</p>

Changing your company name isn’t going to solve all your problems.</h2><p>When we first started to talk about rebranding the company, we knew our name wasn’t our only issue, but it was part of the puzzle. We knew the ATG acronym was confusing and hard for customers to remember; however, a new name wasn’t going to be a magic Band-Aid that resulted<a href="https://www.marketingweek.com/2016/06/30/how-to-create-a-sticky-brand/&#39;" target="_blank" rel="external">in instant organic traffic and a sticky brand</a>.</p>
<p>Before you rebrand your company, you need to reevaluate your overall strategy and offering.</p>
<p>We used data and customer insights to accomplish several things: We redefined<a href="https://www.marketingweek.com/2016/06/30/how-to-create-a-sticky-brand/&#39;" target="_blank" rel="external">our target audience</a>, established a new strategy for our products and services, and created a plan to overhaul the look and feel of the website. It took us two years to take our offering from 4 million to 1 million items, and refine the selection with a focus on high-quality, design-forward brands.</p>

<p>We also added and improved services to support those brands. We now offer one-on-one service through our personal concierge team, professional installation and assembly services, more robust pro services and access to design partners who provide original content and designinspiration. Once we had that in place, we felt confident we were ready to reintroduce ourselves as The Mine.</p>

Brainstorming is great, but it’s also good to focus that effort in ways that will result in a usable concept.</p>
<p>I think people probably imagine a very creative process, and it is, but it’s also very methodical. Or, it probably should be to make sure you’ve uncovered and considered every available option.</p>

Having both internal and external players helps gain perspective, but less is often more in this kind of situation.</p>

<p>We announced ourrebrandingas The Mine to the team about two months prior to launch, and we learned right away that we should’ve given them more time with the concept. The rebranding team felt very familiar with it because they’d been working on it for so long, but the extended team was surprised by the news. They had a lot of questions, and we learned we needed to more thoroughly explain the “why’s” moving forward.</p>

If you wait until you’re 100 percent ready to rebrand, you’ll end up waiting forever.</p>

We received a lot of feedback from team members who were unsure about the rebrand; they liked ATG, and they were proud to be a part of that.</p>
<p>Of course, loved hearing that, and we realized we needed to find a way to let people know that they were a part of it, and that – at the end of the day – we weren’t changing as a family. So, we call ourselves The Minds Behind The Mine. We all have a part, and each is as valued as the next.</p>

<p>We invited Alexa Hampton, design icon and owner of the Manhattan-based design firm Mark Hampton LLC, to be our creative director early on in the rebrand, and she has been an invaluable resource.</p>
<p>She participated directly in the creative process, which helped give her some ownership in that. And so, when it came time to promote it, she was ready with plenty of stories to tell. It was great for us, because she’s a respected member of the design community, and it was good for her because she got to help shape the destiny of a company – kind of a big deal.</p>

<p>It was incredibly helpful, because once we saw our options (and there were hundreds) we knew right away we weren’t going traditional. The firm pulled from several different industries, and our style definitely borrows from fashion and beauty, perhaps even more than furniture, but that’s what makes sense for The Mine.</p>

But, after much research and testing, we decided we didn’t want to oversell it, or make it look like we were trying too hard.</p>
<p>And, that ended up being a great call. Now, we have a name and logo with more versatility, and it invites our customers to explore a little bit. It’s also got a more exclusive feel, which can be hard to convey once you start using imagery.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Is the keyboard faster than the mouse?</strong></p>
<p>Which is faster, keyboard or mouse? A large number of programmers believe that the keyboard is faster for all (programming-related) tasks. However, there are a few widely cited webpages that claim that “studies” show that using the mouse is faster than using the keyboard for everything and that people who think that using the keyboard is faster are just deluding themselves. This might sound extreme, but, just for example, one page says that the author has “never seen [the keyboard] outperform the mouse”.</p>
<p>But it can’t be the case that the mouse is faster for everything – almost no one is faster at clicking on an on-screen keyboard with a mouse than typing at a physical keyboard. Conversely, there are tasks for which mice are much better suited than keyboards (e.g., aiming in FPS games). For someone without an agenda, the question shouldn’t be, which is faster at all tasks, but which tasks are faster with a keyboard, which are faster with a mouse, and which are faster when both are used?</p>
<p>To start, let’s look at the cited studies to see where the mouse is really faster. Most references on the web, when followed all the way back, point to the AskTog, a site by<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Tognazzini" target="_blank" rel="external">Bruce Tognazzini</a>, who describes himself as a “recognized leader in human/computer interaction design”.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.asktog.com/TOI/toi06KeyboardVMouse1.html" target="_blank" rel="external">The most cited AskTog page on the topic claims that they’ve spent $50M of R&amp;D and done all kinds of studies</a>; the page claims that, among other things, the $50M in R&amp;D showed “Test subjects consistently report that keyboarding is faster than mousing” and “The stopwatch consistently proves mousing is faster than keyboarding. ”. The claim is that this both proves that the mouse is faster than the keyboard, and explains why programmers think the keyboard is faster than the mouse even though it’s slower. However, the result unreproducible because “Tog” doesn’t not only doesn’t cite the details of the experiments, Tog doesn’t even describe the experiments and just makes a blanket claim.</p>
<p>The<a href="http://www.asktog.com/TOI/toi22KeyboardVMouse2.html" target="_blank" rel="external">second widely cited AskTog page</a>is in response to a response to the previous page, and it simply repeats that the first page showed that keyboard shortcuts are slower. While there’s a lot of sarcasm, like “Perhaps we have all been misled these years. Perhaps the independent studies that show over and over again that Macintosh users are more productive, can learn quicker, buy more software packages, etc., etc., etc., are somehow all flawed. Perhaps….” no actual results are cited, as before. There is, however, a psuedo-scientific explanation of why the mouse is faster than the keyboard:</p>
<p>Command Keys Aren’t Faster. As you know from my August column, it takes just as long to decide upon a command key as it does to access the mouse. The difference is that the command-key decision is a high-level cognitive function of which there is no long-term memory generated. Therefore, subjectively, keys seem faster when in fact they usually take just as long to use.</p>
<p>Since mouse acquisition is a low-level cognitive function, the user need not abandon cognitive process on the primary task during the acquisition period. Therefore, the mouse acquirer achieves greater productivity.</p>
<p>One question this raises is, why should typing on the keyboard be any different from using command keys? There certainly are people who aren’t fluent at touch typing who have to think about which key they’re going to press when they type. Those people are very slow typists, perhaps even slower than someone who’s quick at using the mouse to type via an on screen keyboard. But there are also people who are fluent with the keyboard and can type without consciously thinking about which keys they’re going to press. The implicit claim here is that it’s not possible to be fluent with command keys in the same way it’s possible to be fluent with the keyboard for typing. It’s possible that’s true, but I find the claim to be highly implausible, both in principle, and from having observed people who certainly seem to be fluent with command keys, and the claim has no supporting evidence.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.asktog.com/SunWorldColumns/S02KeyboardVMouse3.html" target="_blank" rel="external">The third widely cited AskTog page cites a single experiment</a>, where the author typed a paragraph and then had to replace every “e” with a “|”, either using cursor keys or the mouse. The author found that the average time for using cursor keys was 99.43 seconds and the average time for the mouse was 50.22 seconds. No information about the length of the paragraph or the number of “e”s was given. The third page was in response to a user who cited specific editing examples where they found that they were faster with a keyboard than with a mouse.</p>
<p>My experience with benchmarking is that the vast majority of microbenchmarks have wrong or misleading results because they’re difficult to set up properly, and even when set up properly, understanding how the microbenchmark results relate to real-world world results requires a deep understanding of the domain. As a result, I’m deeply skeptical of broad claims that come from microbenchmarks unless the author has a demonstrated, deep, understanding of benchmarking their particular domain, and even then I’ll ask why they believe their result generalizes. The opinion that microbenchmarks are very difficult to interpret properly is<a href="https://twitter.com/shipilev/status/709982588673388544" target="_blank" rel="external">widely shared among people who understand benchmarking</a>.</p>
<p>The<code>e -&gt; |</code>replacement task described is not only a microbenchmark, it’s a bizarrely artificial microbenchmark.</p>
<p>Based on the times given in the result, the task was either for very naive users, or disallowed any kind of search and replace functionality. This particular AskTog column is in response to a programmer who mentioned editing tasks, so the microbenchmark is meaningless unless that programmer is trapped in an experiment where they’re not allowed to use their editor’s basic functionality. Moreover, the replacement task itself is unrealistic – how often do people replace<code>e</code>with<code>|</code>?</p>
<p>I timed this task without the bizarre no-search-and-replace restriction removed and got the following results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keyboard shortcut: 1.26s</li>
<li>M-x, “replace-string” (instead of using mapped keyboard shortcut): 2.8s</li>
<li>Navigate to search and replace with mouse: 5.39s</li>
</ul>
<p>The first result was from using a keyboard shortcut. The second result is something I might do if I were in someone else’s emacs setup, which has different keyboard shortcuts mapped; emacs lets you run a command by hitting “M-x” and typing the entire name of the command. That’s much slower than using a keyboard shortcut directly, but still faster than using the mouse (at least for me, here) Does this mean that keyboards are great and mice are terrible? No, the result is nearly totally meaningless because I spend almost none of my time doing single-character search-and-replace, making the speed of single-character search-and-replace irrelevant.</p>
<p>Also, since I’m used to using the keyboard, the mouse speed here is probably unusually slow. That’s doubly true here because my normal editor setup (<code>emacs -nw</code>) doesn’t allow for mouse usage, so I ended up using an unfamiliar editor,<code>TextEdit</code>, for the mouse test. I did each task once in order to avoid “practicing” the exact task, which could unrealistically make the keyboard-shortcut version nearly instantaneous because it’s easy to hit a practiced sequence of keys very quickly. However, this meant that I was using an unfamiliar mouse in an unfamiliar set of menus for the mouse. Furthermore, like many people who’ve played FPS games in the distant past, I’m used to having “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=mouse+acceleration" target="_blank" rel="external">mouse acceleration</a>” turned off, but the Mac has this on by default and I didn’t go through the rigmarole necessary to disable mouse acceleration. Additionally, recording program I used (quicktime) made the entire machine laggy, which probably affects mousing speed more than keyboard speed, and the menu setup for the program I happened to use forced me to navigate through two levels of menus.</p>
<p>That being said, despite not being used to the mouse, if I want to find a microbenchmark where I’m faster with the mouse than with the keyboard, that’s easy: let me try selecting a block of text that’s on the screen but not near my cursor:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keyboard: 1.8s</li>
<li>Mouse: 0.7s</li>
</ul>
<p>I tend to do selection of blocks in emacs by searching for something at the start of the block, setting a mark, and then searching for something at the end of the mark. I typically type three characters to make sure that I get a unique chunk of text (and I’ll type more if it’s text where I don’t think three characters will cut it). This makes the selection task somewhat slower than the replacement task because the replacement task used single characters and this task used multiple characters.</p>
<p>The mouse is so much better suited for selecting a block of text that even with an unfamiliar mouse setup where I end up having to make a correction instead of being able to do the selection in one motion, the mouse is over twice as fast. But, if I wanted select something that was off screen and the selection was so large that it wouldn’t fit on one screen, the keyboard time wouldn’t change and the mouse time would get much slower, making the keyboard faster.</p>
<p>In addition to doing the measurements, I also (informally) polled people to ask if they thought the keyboard or the mouse would be faster for specific tasks. Both search-and-replace and select-text are tasks where the result was obvious to most people. But not all tasks are obvious; scrolling was one where people didn’t have strong opinions one way or another. Let’s look at scrolling, which is a task both the keyboard and the mouse are well suited for. To have something concrete, let’s look at scrolling down 4 pages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keyboard: 0.49s</li>
<li>Mouse: 0.57s</li>
</ul>
<p>While there’s some difference, and I suspect that if I repeated the experiment enough times I could get a statistically significant result, but the difference is small enough that the difference isn’t of practical significance.</p>
<p>Contra Tog’s result, which was that everyone believes the keyboard was faster even though the mouse is faster, I find that people are pretty good at estimating what’s which device is faster for which tasks and also at estimate when both devices will give a similar result. One possible reason is that I’m polling programmers, and in particular, programmers at<a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=b504af89e87b77920c9b60b2a1f6d5e8" target="_blank" rel="external">RC</a>, who are probably a different population than whoever Tog might’ve studied in his studies. He was in a group that was looking at how to design the UI for a general purpose computer in the 80s, where it would have been actually been unreasonable to focus on studying people, many of whom grew up using computers, and then chose a career where you use computers all day. The equivalent population would’ve had to start using computers in the 60s or even earlier, but even if they had, input devices were quite different (the ball mouse wasn’t invented until 1972, and it certainly wasn’t in wide use the moment it was invented). There’s nothing wrong with studying populations who aren’t relatively expert at using computer input devices, but there is something wrong with generalizing those results to people who are relatively expert.</p>
<p>Unlike claims by either keyboard or mouse advocates, when I do experiments myself, the results are mixed. Some tasks are substantially faster if I use the keyboard and some are substantially faster if I use the mouse. Moreover, most of the results are easily predictable (when the results are similar, the prediction is that it would be hard to predict). If we look at the most widely cited, authoritative, results on the web, we find that they make very strong claims that the mouse is much faster than the keyboard but back up the claim with nothing but a single, bogus, experiment. It’s possible that some of the vaunted $50M in R&amp;D went into valid experiments, but those experiments, if they exist, aren’t cited.</p>
<p>I spent some time reviewing the literature on the subject, but couldn’t find anything conclusive. Rather than do a point-by-point summary of each study (<a href="https://danluu.com/empirical-pl/" target="_blank" rel="external">like I did here for here for another controversial topic</a>), I’ll mention the high-level issues that make the studies irrelevant to me. All studies I could find had at least one of the issues listed below; if you have a link to a study that isn’t irrelevant for one of the following reasons, I’d love to hear about it!</p>
<ol>
<li>Age of study: it’s unclear how a study on interacting with computers from the mid-80s transfers to how people interact with computers today. Even ignoring differences in editing programs, there are large differences in the interface. Mice are more precise and a decent modern optical mouse can be moved as fast as a human can move it without the tracking becoming erratic, something that isn’t true of any mouse I’ve tried from the 80s and was only true of high quality mice from the 90s when the balls were recently cleaned and the mouse was on a decent quality mousepad. Keyboards haven’t improved as much, but even so, I can type substantially faster a modern, low-travel, keyboard than on any keyboard I’ve tried from the 80s.</li>
<li>Narrow microbenchmarking: not all of these are as irrelevant as the<br><code>e -</code><br><code>&gt;</code><br><code>|</code><br>without search and replace task, but even in the case of tasks that aren’t obviously irrelevant, it’s not clear what the impact of the result is on actual work I might do.</li>
<li>Not keyboard vs. mouse: a tiny fraction of published studies are on keyboard vs. mouse interaction. When a study is on device interaction, it’s often about some new kind of device or a new interaction model.</li>
<li>Vague description: a lot of studies will say something like they found a 7.8% improvement, with results being significant with p<br>&lt;<br> 0.005, without providing enough information to tell if the results are actually significant or merely statistically significant (recall that the practically insignificant scrolling result was a 0.08s difference, which could also be reported as a 16.3% improvement).</li>
<li>Unskilled users: in one, typical, paper, they note that it can take users as long as two seconds to move the mouse from one side of the screen to a scrollbar on the other side of the screen. While there’s something to be said for doing studies on unskilled users in order to figure out what sorts of interfaces are easiest for users who have the hardest time, a study on users who take 2 seconds to get their mouse onto the scrollbar doesn’t appear to be relevant to my user experience. When I timed this for myself, it took 0.21s to get to the scrollbar from the other side of the screen and scroll a short distance, despite using an unfamiliar mouse with different sensitivity than I’m used to and running a recording program which made mousing more difficult than usual.</li>
<li>Seemingly unreasonable results: some studies claim to show large improvements in overall productivity when switching from type of device to another (e.g., a 20% total productivity gain from switching types of mice).</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>It’s entirely possible that the mysterious studies Tog’s org spent $50M on prove that the mouse is faster than the keyboard for all tasks other than raw text input, but there doesn’t appear to be enough information to tell what the actual studies were. There are many public studies on user input, but I couldn’t find any that are relevant to whether or not I should use the mouse more or less at the margin.</p>
<p>When I look at various tasks myself, the results are mixed, and they’re mixed in the way that most programmers I polled predicted. This result is so boring that it wouldn’t be worth mentioning if not for the large groups of people who believe that either the keyboard is always faster than the mouse or vice versa.</p>
<p>Please let me know if there are relevant studies on this topic that I should read! I’m not familiar with the relevant fields, so it’s possible that I’m searching with the wrong keywords and reading the wrong papers.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the unique parts of being a web designer is that the job never stops evolving. From static HTML all the way to Content Management Systems – the way we bring functionality to the web is always moving forward. And the actual practice of design marches through various trends and techniques as well.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there are a plethora of languages that we use to bring form and function together. Think of the many<a href="https://speckyboy.com/top-50-javascript/" target="_blank" rel="external">JavaScript frameworks</a>we’re using, ever-evolving CSS or even PHP. Sometimes it feels like this is the career equivalent of hitting a moving target.</p>
<p>Keeping up with it all isn’t easy. For one, learning takes time – which is often difficult to find. Plus, there are simply too many things to know. It can be hard to determine which skills to pick up and which to save for a later date.</p>
<p>Frankly, the whole thing can feel a bit overwhelming. But it doesn’t have to be. Here are some things to keep in mind when it comes to learning and sharpening your skills.</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/eu6vMzE.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="Learning-is-What-You-Make-of-it"><a href="#Learning-is-What-You-Make-of-it" class="headerlink" title="Learning is What You Make of it"></a>Learning is What You Make of it</h2><p>When you’ve been at this for awhile, it’s easy to get comfortable with what you know and how you do things. That’s a completely natural philosophy, though. You’re simply leaning on your existing knowledge and calling on your past experience – all in the name of getting things done.</p>
<p>But, with the rapid pace of change in this industry, sitting in your easy chair means falling behind. Do that for too long and, before you know it, things have passed you by.</p>
<p>For me, motivation has always been a bit difficult to find when it comes to learning. I was never one to enjoy traditional schooling. Most of the skills I’ve picked up have been a result of tinkering with projects and learning only when I needed to.</p>
<p>Part of the challenge is that we often tell ourselves that we don’t have the time or energy to make the commitment. Between work and the rest of life’s duties, it’s quite understandable. That said, you can do it with the right approach.</p>
<p>It’s imperative that you make time to further your skills. The good news is that it doesn’t mean you have to quit your job to attend classes. Because of the sheer number of learning options (many of them available online and for free), you have the ability to learn on your own schedule and at your own pace.</p>
<p>The happy truth is that you don’t have to commit an enormous amount of time. Even if you can only squeeze in a 20 minute learning session a few times per week, you’re making progress. Once you realize that you can do this in bite-size portions, it starts to feel like much less of a burden.</p>
<p><img src="http://img1.tuicool.com/r67F73R.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="Choosing-a-Skill"><a href="#Choosing-a-Skill" class="headerlink" title="Choosing a Skill"></a>Choosing a Skill</h2><p>Another dilemma we face is figuring out just what it is that we should commit to learning. Again, the choices can feel overwhelming.</p>
<p>There are so many “next big thing” types of languages and techniques being hyped. It almost feels like you’re obliged to learn them, even if they’re not particularly exciting or relevant to you.</p>
<p>The great thing here is that you really can choose anything you want. Perhaps you’re struggling with a particular aspect of your job and see an opportunity to improve. Or maybe there’s just something out there that really interests you. There really is no right or wrong answer.</p>
<p>In my own path, I’ve realized that I’m a bit over my head when it comes to certain tasks inPHP. So I decided to do something about it by taking an online course. I’m getting up early and putting in a few hours per week. It’s nothing earth-shattering, and I may never become a full-on expert. But I actually feel better building upon the skills I already had.</p>
<p>The point is that you get to make a personal decision on what is worth your time and effort. Regardless of what anyone else says is worthwhile; it’s ultimately up to you to decide.</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/MFruqyV.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="Improve-Yourself-and-Your-Career"><a href="#Improve-Yourself-and-Your-Career" class="headerlink" title="Improve Yourself and Your Career"></a>Improve Yourself and Your Career</h2><p>Another benefit of learning is that it can be great for your self-confidence. The first time you get to use what you’ve learned makes you feel on top of the world. Plus, having that new or improved skill in hand may just convince you to bid on a project that you wouldn’t have before.</p>
<p>It’s really cool to see the snowball effect this all has. You can go from being a bit timid about your ability to accomplish something to actually accomplishing it. And, once you start seeing the real-world benefits of self-improvement, you’ll want to keep on rolling. That can lead you to bigger and better places.</p>
<p>Continuing to educate yourself and improving your skills as a web designer is very much a worthwhile endeavor. And we’re fortunate that our particular industry is full ofresources to help us along the way.</p>
<p>Take advantage of the opportunity to learn. You might be amazed at what it can do for you and your career.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Presented by Akamai</p>
<p>[Me]: To keep your players happy – you need to understand why they’re not.</p>
<p>[You]: Uh, yeah obviously. Thanks. So what?</p>
<p>Actually, I have a lot to say on the topic of keeping players happy. A few months back I wrote a quick post about<a href="https://blogs.akamai.com/2017/02/friction-hurts-especially-in-gaming.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Friction</a>.</p>
<p>Friction,as I defined it, is anything that prompts your player to leave your game and look elsewhere. And you know the scare stats (right?): 95 percent of players leave a game within its first 30 days.</p>
<p>Fear mongering aside; I think it’s a topic so important that I even wrote an entire<a href="https://content.akamai.com/am-en-pg9012-frictionless-ebook.html" target="_blank" rel="external">book</a>about it. Today I’d like to dive a bit more into what friction means, and why it’s worth your time to read more about it.</p>
<p>I settled on the term Friction, and the grid below, to help you build a framework to think about how best to keep your players happy. A lot of your work already goes into creating cool, fun, delightful experiences, but I’d argue that the obstacles are just as critical as the delight. Everything that gets in the way of the cool and the fun will kill the player experience.</p>
<h2 id="Seeking-understanding"><a href="#Seeking-understanding" class="headerlink" title="Seeking understanding"></a>Seeking understanding</h2><p>Understanding Frictions means understanding the myriad points of contact with your players, and mapping out problem areas well in advance. This starts with game design, and goes all the way through marketing and post-launch. It helps to think about frictions in terms of consequences and outcomes.</p>
<p>Given enough sources or intensities of friction, players will quit. And once they’re gone, it can be very difficult to get them back. That abandonment can affect not only the specific game but the studio’s reputation and future projects for years to come.</p>
<p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/AZrERzj.png!web" alt=""></p>
<p>To make it easy, I’ve laid out a straightforward way to conceptualize frictions in the grid below. This will help you to understand where they fall, how they intersect and interact, and what they mean to you.<a href="https://content.akamai.com/am-en-pg9012-frictionless-ebook.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Frictionless</a>goes deeper into helping you prepare for and manage them as they arise during your development cycles and throughout community-building and engagement, from announcement to launch and beyond.</p>
<p>The grid is broken up into quadrants along two axes. “Harmful” and “Beneficial” along the X-axis, and “Avoidable” and “Unavoidable” along the Y-axis. Most frictions leech player satisfaction and disrupt immersion, although some can, as noted on the grid, be good for you. Your job is to recognize the different kinds of frictions, then manage and solve for them.</p>
<p>So what are some examples of frictions? Consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost</li>
<li>Payment Method</li>
<li>Game Difficulty</li>
<li>Customization</li>
<li>Hardware</li>
<li>Language</li>
<li>Time-to-play</li>
<li>Accessibility Issues</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you really get into mapping out frictions, you’ll find that many of them can end up in multiple places on the grid. Aha.<em>There’s the rub</em>(that’s a friction joke in case you missed it). You goal is to identify those that end up on the “harmful” side of the grid, and figure out how to flip them over to beneficial.</p>
<p>Is this a really difficult game (a la_Dark Souls)?_Market it as such. You obviously have to get players to pay for your game. Make sure the price is right, or make sure it’s folded naturally into a solid freemium design.</p>
<p>Are your cutscenes unskippable? Fix that before launch, or patch ASAP post-launch.</p>
<p>Looking back at our list again — it’s a bit of a hodge-podge. It would help to add further organization. In the book, I’ve broken down sources of Friction into three different source types:</p>
<ol>
<li>Player Frictions</li>
<li>Game Frictions</li>
<li>Publisher Frictions</li>
</ol>
<p>If we reorganize our list, we come up with:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left"><strong>Player Frictions</strong></th>
<th style="text-align:left"><strong>Game Frictions</strong></th>
<th style="text-align:left"><strong>Publisher Frictions</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Accessibility Issues</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Difficulty</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Cost</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"></td>
<td style="text-align:left">Graphics/Style</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Payment Method</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"></td>
<td style="text-align:left">Multi-player</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Hardware</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"></td>
<td style="text-align:left">Customizability</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"></td>
<td style="text-align:left">Repetitive Download</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Time-to-play</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I’m sure just by looking at this rough grid, you’re already coming up with a host of missing items; and you’re likely already categorizing them. Good! Keep going.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In January 2011 I was on summer break, but instead of getting a day job, or socializing, I spent a lot of time holed up in my room writing the first version of an iOS app called<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/class-timetable/id425121147?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="external">Class Timetable</a>. The year before, I’d been looking for a simple, easy to use timetable app, and nothing on the App Store quite fit the bill - everything was too complicated and hard to use. The idea was to create a no fuss, straight forward solution, something that was easier and more convenient than a paper timetable/schedule. Over a few months, I spent about 500 hours designing and coding it. Fast forward to today, and the app has had more than three million downloads, a lot of positive App Store ratings, and at times has been my primary source of income. Haven’t heard of the app? Yeah, it hasn’t taken off yet in the US, but is reasonably popular in Aus/NZ/UK, at least among college and school students.</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/32Evqin.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>I’ve read a bunch of blogs recently about people that hit the jackpot, got their app featured, and were looking at figures like 100,000 downloads a day. In comparison, I’ve only been moderately successful. Class Timetable has never made the App Store #1 position, I didn’t become rich overnight, and I’ve failed more times than I’ve succeeded. I’ve invested a lot of time, probably thousands of hours all up, unlike some hit apps that were created in a weekend. Sure, three million downloads is a lot, but that’s happened over more than six years.</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/mMvUFrR.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>Instead, my ‘moderate success’ story is closer to one of hard work, and slow, steady progress. It’s probably more true to real life than other success stories, because let’s face it: not everyone is going to wind up creating the next Flappy Bird. Instead of being a viral hit, Class Timetable has been doing moderately well for more than six years, which is a little special in itself - many #1 apps can’t claim a lifespan that long. I’d like to share a few things I’ve learned over the last few years, so hopefully there’s something here you’ll find useful, no matter how much success you have, or haven’t (yet) seen.</p>
<h3 id="Before-writing-an-app-that-‘made-it’-I-wrote-plenty-that-didn’t-make-it"><a href="#Before-writing-an-app-that-‘made-it’-I-wrote-plenty-that-didn’t-make-it" class="headerlink" title="Before writing an app that ‘made it’, I wrote plenty that didn’t make it."></a>Before writing an app that ‘made it’, I wrote plenty that didn’t make it.</h3><p>I still think some of them were great ideas - perhaps they just needed some great marketing, or a little luck. There was one called ‘Ginge-O-Meter’ that I put a lot of work into. The concept: take a photo of someone, and find out how ginger their hair is. It used real image recognition and color analysis techniques to deliver an answer, and it actually worked (most of the time). Unfortunately, the idea didn’t catch… I think I made about $50. It was my big shot, and to be quite honest I was pretty dismayed at how much work I put in to see it fail. But I didn’t stop there, and Class Timetable went on to become what it is today. Anyway, my point here is not to hedge your bets.If your winning idea doesn’t succeed: get up and try again, and again… and again, because for all you know your next idea could be the one that makes it.</p>
<h3 id="Design-everything-around-the-first-time-user"><a href="#Design-everything-around-the-first-time-user" class="headerlink" title="Design everything around the first time user."></a>Design everything around the first time user.</h3><p>Imagine getting an email in all caps, telling you that you that your app is stuck ‘installing’ and that you need to fix it… pretty frustrating, right? After a few emails like this, you realize that you can never make your product simple enough to use. What I’ve learned (aside from sucking it up, and sending a kind, helpful response) is: design your product as if it was going to be used by people that are a software literacy step below the target user. Keep it simple, make it idiot proof - design everything around the first time user experience. Make sure there’s nowhere people can get tripped up, and that every task has a straight forward, simple workflow. Less time will be spent on support, people will be happier in general with your product, and your ratings will go up. When Class Timetable first started getting thousands of downloads a day, I’d average around twenty emails a week. I’m sure there were other users with the same issues that couldn’t be bothered sending an email, and instead would simply stop using the app. By refining the product areas that led to these emails, I’m now down to an email every two or three days - and most of these are things that aren’t real issues, like feature suggestions, or the occasional fan email (really).</p>
<h3 id="Listen-to-your-critics-but-don’t-do-what-they-say"><a href="#Listen-to-your-critics-but-don’t-do-what-they-say" class="headerlink" title="Listen to your critics, but don’t do what they say."></a>Listen to your critics, but don’t do what they say.</h3><p>I must have had hundreds of feature request emails from customers, ranging from really good, to very questionable. Now, if I implemented all of those features, the app would be a confusing mess, with 17 background choices, 72 different things vying for your attention on screen, and a settings option for just about everything. Heck, even if I just implemented every sensible idea, the result wouldn’t be too much different. The problem is that even when users can see a genuine product issue, they can’t always see the best solution. So what can we do instead? Listen to your users -<em>to their real, underlying problems</em>- and solve them in a way that takes the product as a whole forward. Sometimes, a great feature suggestion might have downsides for the product as a whole, which means letting it go. This would often happen with Class Timetable: one of its primary features is simplicity and ease of use. While many features have been added to it over the years, a lot of feature suggestions would have made the product as a whole more complicated. Sometimes that was OK, but more often than not I opted for simplicity, the feature that kept it unique.</p>
<h3 id="A-great-product-is-better-than-a-viral-gimmick"><a href="#A-great-product-is-better-than-a-viral-gimmick" class="headerlink" title="A great product is better than a viral gimmick."></a>A great product is better than a viral gimmick.</h3><p>Class Timetable has never made the App Store front page, or had 100,000 downloads in a day - but that doesn’t matter to me. Some apps reach the #1 spot on the charts, only to become wastelands not even a year later. Perhaps they had a funny quip, viral marketing strategy, or just got lucky - but ultimately, they didn’t have any substance, and they didn’t solve a real world problem in a useful way. By making a genuinely great product, you’re designing something that your users keep coming back to again and again. Put in effort where people might not even notice. Focus on solving real problems, and making a product that is so genuinely useful that your users are coming back and bringing others with them.Returning users is a great sign that your product is healthy.As a bonus, there’s a small viral effect that every active user has, and it’s always great to know that your next customer isn’t just replacing someone that left.</p>
<h3 id="Be-generous"><a href="#Be-generous" class="headerlink" title="Be generous."></a>Be generous.</h3><p>When Class Timetable first went on the App Store, it was a paid $1 download. I figured that for the amount of effort I had put in (~500 hours), $1 was a steal. Anyway, in the first week, 4 people bought the app, and the next week, even less than that. Not sure what it feels like to hit the jackpot, but this didn’t quite feel like it. 500 hours is a lot of time to throw down the drain! I could have left it to die a slow death earning $1 a week, but instead I decided to make the app free. I’d created it to solve a real problem, and I figured that others would find it genuinely useful. Almost straight away, downloads started to pick up. 50 downloads a day, then 100, 1000… wow. Had I held onto the amount of hours I put in and not been generous, I very much doubt that downloads would ever have picked up. Soon after, I added an in app purchase enabling extra features, which now has quite a reasonable uptake. Much higher than a few dollars a week anyway. So, don’t be stingy: a product with no paying users is (usually) better than a paid product with no users.It’s much easier to upsell to an existing customer than it is to find an entirely new paying customer.</p>
<h3 id="Take-a-step-back-often"><a href="#Take-a-step-back-often" class="headerlink" title="Take a step back, often."></a>Take a step back, often.</h3><p>Sometimes you’re stuck on a problem, and there just don’t seem to be any great solutions: maybe it’s related to a piece of code you’re writing, or decisions around how you’re going to market your app. Then, you start thinking about the problem from a wider perspective. You realize that you won’t need to even write the tricky piece of code if you architect it the right way, and that the marketing decision is one your friend (who has a knack for that sort of problem) would know how to tackle. You could sum it up as ‘taking a step back’ from the problem. In my entire software career, there’s not a second I’ve spent doing this that I’ve regretted. There’s been plenty of times, especially early on, that I wish I did this and never did. I learned the hard way with Class Timetable: with version 1.0, I spent a lot of time just ‘getting stuck in’ and coding it. I solved tricky problems by cutting corners and ‘making it happen’, instead of taking a step back. As long as users never knew, it was fine right? A year or two later, I had to rewrite the entire codebase from scratch - for so many reasons - which was a massive undertaking. Take a step back! It’s worth it.</p>
<p>Today, Class Timetable continues to do well. I’m always looking to the future, whether that means the next iOS upgrade, or a bigger picture of what Class Timetable could evolve into. If you’re studying at school or college, feel free to<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/class-timetable/id425121147?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="external">give it a go</a>- I hope you find it genuinely useful.</p>

<h4 id="Okay-so-what-about-icon-fonts"><a href="#Okay-so-what-about-icon-fonts" class="headerlink" title="Okay, so what about icon fonts?"></a>Okay, so what about icon fonts?</h4><p>Icon fonts like FontAwesome came out as a way to soften the agony of working with icons, but they still aren’t perfect.<strong>Designing</strong>with them is just…<em>okay</em>; you still have to go look up the glyph, copy it, and paste it into the text layer. You can’t really symbolize them, and if you do, changing their color requires some text symbol trickery.<strong>Developing</strong>with icon fonts is simple, but not without issues. If the browser fails to load the icon font, then you’re up shit creek without a paddle. And you’re alone. In a kayak.<em>Sad.</em></p>

<p>Well…now what?</p>
<h4 id="So…use-SVGs-then"><a href="#So…use-SVGs-then" class="headerlink" title="So…use SVGs then?"></a>So…use SVGs then?</h4><p>Well for<strong>designers</strong>, SVGs are certainly easier to symbolize in Sketch, but it can be kind of a pain to change their color._So just don’t make them symbols, right? Then you can use layer styles to make them different colors!_But what if you want to update the little dropdown arrow from a caret to a triangle? Well good luck finding all 398 occurrences of that little arrow and updating them one-by-one. So that’s…well,<em>not great</em>. And I know from experience that<strong>developers</strong>love nothing more than using standalone SVGs for each and every icon in my design. Don’t worry guys, there are only 207 unique icons. That shouldn’t affect page load. I promise. /s</p>
<h4 id="Ugh-then-what"><a href="#Ugh-then-what" class="headerlink" title="Ugh, then what?!"></a>Ugh, then what?!</h4><p>Keep reading, knucklehead �� And before we dive in, here’s something free. This will help you follow along with the rest of the tutorial.</p>
<h3 id="My-Workflow"><a href="#My-Workflow" class="headerlink" title="My Workflow"></a>My Workflow</h3><p>My approach is divided into two parts:<strong>What I Do for Design</strong>and<strong>What I Do for Development</strong>. Neither technique is completely perfect, but it’s been successful so far, and makes the most people happy along the way.</p>
<p>That’s important!</p>
<h3 id="What-I-Do-For-Designers"><a href="#What-I-Do-For-Designers" class="headerlink" title="What I Do For Designers"></a>What I Do For Designers</h3><p>I<strong>absolutely love</strong>the Nucleo icon set. There are 8,300+ icons available in all kinds of different styles (outlined, solid, mini, full color, two-toned), and they’ve even included those pesky social icons that you need on pretty much every project. You can grab those below ($49 for a year, $129 for life).</p>

<p>The absolute fastest and most sustainable way to use icons in Sketch is by using<strong>color symbols and masks</strong>. You’ve seen this technique before thanks to my palFrancesco, but here’s a quick refresher:</p>
<p><a href="https://freeandwilling.com/fbmore?go=Sketch-Tint-Icons-Using-Nested-Symbols-UX-PowerTools" target="_blank" rel="external">Sketch: Tint icons using nested symbols - Design&amp;Prototype - Medium_I always wanted to create a single version of an icon and apply different colors to, or tint it, to indicate its state…_freeandwilling.com</a></p>
<p>Step 1:Make symbols for the fill colors you want to use for your icons. Make sure every color symbol artboard is the same size.</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/yMfyi2v.png!web" alt=""></p>
<p>Step 2:Make a new artboard for your icon symbol. Paste your icon onto your new artboard. If you’re using the<a href="https://freeandwilling.com/Jon?go=icon-article-nucleo" target="_blank" rel="external">Nucleo Icon</a>desktop app, just drag the icon directly into Sketch, then put it on your new artboard.</p>
<p><img src="http://img1.tuicool.com/rYzeMjy.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Step 3:Make sure your icon is a single shape, and set it as a mask. If your icon isn’t a single shape, then select the different paths and union them.</p>
<p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/AbmUZ3f.png!web" alt=""></p>
<p>Step 4:Insert any of the color symbols on top of your icon mask and resize it to the size of your artboard. You’ll be able to override this color whenever you add an instance of your icon!</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/qERrQzN.png!web" alt=""></p>
<p>Step 5 (Optional):If your icon is a logo (see above), set the mask fill to the brand color of the app. It’s easy to quickly find official brand colors over on<a href="https://brandcolors.net/" target="_blank" rel="external">brandcolors.net</a>. This saves you from having to create color symbols for a bunch of different app colors — if you ever want to use the brand color, just turn OFF the color symbol override:</p>
<p><img src="http://img1.tuicool.com/mEf22ai.gif" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong></p>
<p>If you have color symbols with semi-transparent fills, you’ll be able to see the mask fill through the transparency. So if you want 25% black to be an available color, don’t use a fill on the mask.</p>
<h4 id="Why-This-Works-for-Designers"><a href="#Why-This-Works-for-Designers" class="headerlink" title="Why This Works for Designers"></a>Why This Works for Designers</h4><ul>
<li>All of my icons are symbols, so if I ever want to update them, I can do it in one place and immediately see it update across all of my designs.</li>
<li>I can quickly override the color from the inspector.</li>
<li>If I update a color symbol, it will update all icons that use that color.</li>
<li>I can nest icons inside of other symbols and quickly swap them out.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Why-This-Doesn’t-Work-for-Developers"><a href="#Why-This-Doesn’t-Work-for-Developers" class="headerlink" title="Why This Doesn’t Work for Developers"></a>Why This Doesn’t Work for Developers</h4><ul>
<li>Zeplin and InVision don’t read color overrides, so they’ll only ever show you the color you used in the base symbol.</li>
<li>The color symbol + mask technique adds some bloat to the SVG file size.</li>
<li>They’re all individual SVGs, so devs will want to jump off a bridge.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Side note:</strong>All of the icons in<a href="https://www.uxpower.tools/" target="_blank" rel="external">UX Power Tools</a>are constructed this way. It’s super fast to swap colors, and even easier to swap icons inside of elements like buttons, fields, and notifications.</p>
<h3 id="What-I-Do-For-Developers"><a href="#What-I-Do-For-Developers" class="headerlink" title="What I Do For Developers"></a>What I Do For Developers</h3><p>Zeplin works incredibly well for layout, color, and typography, but isn’t terribly efficient for assets. Instead of having devs pull icons directly from Zeplin (or sending them a zip of SVGs), I use<a href="https://freeandwilling.com/Jon?go=icon-article-nucleo" target="_blank" rel="external">Nucleo</a>to build an SVG sprite, then send that to developers. Not to brag, but they :heart: me for it :relieved:</p>
<p>Step 1:Create a new project in the Nucleo web app.</p>
<p>Step 2:Add icons to your Nucleo project that you intend to use (or have already used) in your designs.</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/qEN7bi7.png!web" alt=""></p>
<p>Step 3:Open the project, select all icons in the right panel, and click<em>Download</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/vUFFRvY.png!web" alt=""></p>
<p>Step 4:Choose your export preferences. “Export as Symbol” uses_xlink:href<em>which will be<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/xlink:href" target="_blank" rel="external">deprecated in SVG 2</a>(not out yet). That being said, it’s just the</em>“xlink”_portion that will no longer be needed, so “Export as Symbol” is still a safe option. I usually choose “Export CSS”, which creates a single SVG sprite, then creates a CSS file with classes for each icon.</p>
<p>But wait, that’s not even the best part!</p>
<p>Along with the SVG sprite and generated CSS, Nucleo also creates an HTML page showing off each icon, and the CSS class for using that icon in code.</p>

<h3 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h3><p>There are fast ways to_<strong>design</strong><em>with icons, and fast ways to</em><strong>develop</strong>_with them. It’s a little extra work to make things optimal for both parties, but it will make everyone’s lives easier.</p>
<p>If you’re not using<a href="https://freeandwilling.com/Jon?go=icon-article-nucleo" target="_blank" rel="external">Nucleo</a>, you can find lots of services like<a href="https://iconizr.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Iconizr</a>that will help you generate an SVG sprite.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We’ve all been faced with egregious examples of UI design at times. They’re infuriating if you actually have to deal with them. But if they’re not actively preventing you from doing something they can be entertaining, and can even provide useful tips on how not to do things.</p>
<p>So, what happens when coders and designers deliberately set out to create staggeringly bad UI? Well, that’s exactly what’s been happening recently over on Reddit.</p>
<p>It started with an innocent enough post in r/ProgrammerHumor, asking, “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/6evbfd/who_can_make_the_best_volume_slider/" target="_blank" rel="external">Who can make the best volume slider?</a>“ and accompanied by this fantastic GIF:</p>
<p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/2myUNv3.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Oh. Oh my word. Who could possibly top this?</p>
<p>This being the internet, things got swiftly out of hand, as this cavalcade of crimes against usability will attest.</p>
<p><img src="http://img1.tuicool.com/77Vnim6.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>‘Hold my beer’</p>

<p>Actual genius</p>

<p>Actually, yeah, why not?</p>

<p>There’s probably a ‘dicey’ pun in this one</p>

<p>Literally pumping up the volume</p>

<p>It’s the bad colour choice that really make this one pop</p>
<p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/2me2Afy.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>But what if you want a volume of more than 90?</p>
<p>Not content with merely creating images and animated GIFs, someone’s even gone to the trouble of making a (sort of) working version of one of our favourites – click and hold the speaker icon to play.</p>

<p>You think you’re safe from malware since you never click suspicious-looking links, then somebody finds a way to infect your PC anyway. Security researchers have<a href="http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/mouseover-otlard-gootkit/" target="_blank" rel="external">discovered</a>that cybercriminals have recently started using a malware downloader that installs a<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013/04/16/watch-out-most-game-hacks-are-actually-malware/" target="_blank" rel="external">banking Trojan</a>to your computer even if you don’t click anything. All it takes to trigger the download is to hover your mouse pointer over a hyperlink in a carrier PowerPoint file.</p>
<p>According to researchers from Trend Micro and<a href="https://www.dodgethissecurity.com/2017/06/02/new-powerpoint-mouseover-based-downloader-analysis-results/" target="_blank" rel="external">Dodge This Security</a>the technique was used by a recent spam email campaign targeting companies and organizations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The emails’ subjects were mostly finance-related, such as “Invoice” and “Order #,” with an attached PowerPoint presentation.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/cb4d93a4905500a6e4fdaa2847e1ae8d/205363154/powerpoint-downloader02.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>[Image credit: Trend Micro]</p>
<p>The PowerPoint file has a single hyperlink in the center that says “Loading… please wait” that has an embedded malicious PowerShell script. When you hover your mouse pointer over the link, it executes the script. If you’re running a newer version of Microsoft Office, though, you’ll still need to approve the malware’s download before it infects your PC.</p>
<p>That’s because the more modern versions of the suite has Protected View, which will show a prompt warning you about a “potential security concern” when the script starts running. Just click Disable, and you’ll be fine. However, older versions of the suite don’t have that extra layer of security. The downloader can install a Trojan virus into your system to steal your credentials and bank account information the moment your mouse pointer hovers over the link.</p>

<p>[Image credit: Trend Micro]</p>
<p>The good news is that the spam emails died down back on May 29th after peaking on the 25th with 1,444 detections by Trend Micro. Still, it’s better to steer clear of similar emails, since it’s always possible that the campaign in May was just a test run for a bigger one.</p>

<p>My colleague just discovered that Chrome 58 (released April 19th) has silently muted all console.debug() output in their Chrome Dev Tools.</p>
<p>How? By making changes to the<strong>Console UI</strong>, from filtering based on type of console method to filtering based on levels.</p>
<p>Introducing levels is not a bad thing in and of itself. But Google also chose to stop showing all console output by default. Now you can only see level “Info” and below.</p>
<p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/zYRFNrZ.png!web" alt=""></p>
<p>Depending on your project, it might also be a big deal to no longer be able to filter by showing only one console method’s output.</p>
<p>For example only<code>console.log()</code>. This is particularly troublesome if you’re working on a larger project with hundreds of different types of output mixed together.</p>
<p>As you can see from the comments section<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/03/devtools-release-notes" target="_blank" rel="external">in the release notes</a>, this has not been received well by developers.</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/UnyyMzj.png!web" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="Failing-Tests"><a href="#Failing-Tests" class="headerlink" title="Failing Tests"></a>Failing Tests</h3><p>This means that if your app or project relies on<code>console.debug()</code>level output for testing, your tests might have been failing for over a month without you even noticing.</p>
<p>All without so much as a pop-up warning from Google.</p>
<p>By making logging non-verbose by default, I believe Google has broken with best practice here, and made a huge mistake.</p>
<p>Also, removing the ability to only show output based on a specific console method has resulted in a worsened workflow for many developers.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Content and design work better together - in fact, your content marketing efforts really won’t achieve optimal success if they don’t include a<a href="http://www.rightsourcemarketing.com/content-creation/cant-win-content-marketing-without-good-design/" target="_blank" rel="external">solid design component</a>to bring your words to life.</p>
<p>Not convinced your content needs design? Here are some recent stats that prove otherwise:</p>
<ul>
<li>37% of marketers said visual marketing was the most important form of content for their business, second only to blogging (38%). (<br><a href="https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SocialMediaMarketingIndustryReport2016.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">Source</a><br>)</li>
<li>Given 15 minutes to consume content, two-thirds of people prefer to read something beautifully designed (as opposed to something plain). (<br><a href="http://wwwimages.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/max/2015/pdfs/state-of-content-oct.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">Source</a><br>)</li>
<li>If the content or layout of a website is unattractive, 38% of people will stop engaging with it. (<br><a href="http://wwwimages.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/max/2015/pdfs/state-of-content-oct.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">Source</a><br>)</li>
<li>When people hear information, they usually only remember about 10% of that information three days later. But if a relevant image is paired with that same information, people will remember 65% of the information three days later. (<br><a href="http://www.brainrules.net/vision" target="_blank" rel="external">Source</a><br>)</li>
<li>Tweets with images receive 150% more retweets than tweets without images. (<br><a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/the-power-of-twitters-new-expanded-images-and-how-to-make-the-most-of-it" target="_blank" rel="external">Source</a><br>)</li>
<li>Not getting enough likes? Facebook posts with images get 2.3 times more engagement vs. those without images. (<br><a href="http://buzzsumo.com/blog/how-to-massively-boost-your-blog-traffic-with-these-5-awesome-image-stats/" target="_blank" rel="external">Source</a><br>)</li>
</ul>
<p>But what to do with those little design projects that pop up, but seem too small to send to your designer - or need to be done too quickly to schedule? We all know what happens when people who aren’t designers try to be… well, graphic designers. You can end up with garish color palettes, no white space, and a jumble of shapes that look more like an abstract painting than an infographic.</p>
<p>But the fact is that even if you_aren’t_trained as a graphic designer, in many companies, your job in marketing is going to require you to dabble in a little design here and there, whether it’s to save time, or money, or both.</p>
<p>As such, a little design knowledge can go a long way, no matter your official title or department. You never know when a small-but-urgent project might come up while your official designer is swamped, or when a proposal will come across your desk featuring art created by your sales person. Or maybe you’re a part of an internal marketing department and routinely try to tackle the small stuff in house so you can send the larger projects to your creative team.</p>
<p>Regardless, you’ll need to work on a design project at some point, and there’s no need for you to look like an amateur when you do it. Here are nine easy-to-use tools that can help any non-designer accomplish common design tasks:</p>
<h2 id="How-to-create-a-quote-Recite"><a href="#How-to-create-a-quote-Recite" class="headerlink" title="How to create a quote:Recite"></a>How to create a quote:<a href="http://recite.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Recite</a></h2><p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/i6FrQvE.jpg!web" alt="">This browser-based tool makes it simple to create and share a quote, fast. Just type in your quote and it will populate into dozens of pre-made templates. You can post directly to Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Tumblr, and StumbleUpon from the Recite website, or download the image directly to share later.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-create-social-media-and-blog-graphics-Canva"><a href="#How-to-create-social-media-and-blog-graphics-Canva" class="headerlink" title="How to create social media and blog graphics:Canva"></a>How to create social media and blog graphics:<a href="https://www.canva.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Canva</a></h2><p>​<img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/u6FJNv7.png!web" alt="">Canva offers a browser-based account, as well as iPhone and iPad apps. You do have to create an account in order to use it, but a regular Canva subscription is free (Canva for Work, which offers more robust features and support, requires a monthly fee). The tool offers lots of pre-sized templates that make it easy to design to certain specifications, such as social media posts, posters, letterhead, and more. You can choose from Canva’s native layouts, icons, and graphics - some are free, and some aren’t - or upload your own to keep things on brand.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-make-charts-and-graphs-Beam"><a href="#How-to-make-charts-and-graphs-Beam" class="headerlink" title="How to make charts and graphs:Beam"></a>How to make charts and graphs:<a href="https://beam.venngage.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Beam</a></h2><p><img src="http://img1.tuicool.com/jaYBZvr.jpg!web" alt="">Beam is a free online chart maker offered by infographic platform Venngage. You don’t need an account to make and save a chart using Beam’s mini website, but you will need to enter your name and email address in order to download your data visualization (you can also opt to embed it, or share it on Facebook and Twitter). Beam enables you to choose from several different types of graphs and color palettes, and you can edit the data in a spreadsheet, similar to PowerPoint - but the end result will be much prettier than a regular old slide deck.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-edit-photos-Pixlr"><a href="#How-to-edit-photos-Pixlr" class="headerlink" title="How to edit photos:Pixlr"></a>How to edit photos:<a href="https://pixlr.com/editor/" target="_blank" rel="external">Pixlr</a></h2><p>​<img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/YvmyUfz.jpg!web" alt="">Need to edit a picture, and your smartphone or computer’s photo program just isn’t cutting it? Then turn to Pixlr, which is basically Photoshop in web browser form, but without the hefty price tag. The functionality is pretty similar to Photoshop, so familiarity with the popular Adobe program will help, but you can pick it up even if you’re never touched Photoshop in your life.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-create-icons-LogoGarden"><a href="#How-to-create-icons-LogoGarden" class="headerlink" title="How to create icons:LogoGarden"></a>How to create icons:<a href="https://www.logogarden.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">LogoGarden</a></h2><p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/NjU3iqj.jpg!web" alt="">Yes, the word “logo” is in the name of this website - but don’t actually use it to make logos. That’s work best left to professionals, however, this website is useful if you need to pull together a suite of little icons for a blog, list, etc. and want to customize the color quickly.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-find-icons-Iconfinder"><a href="#How-to-find-icons-Iconfinder" class="headerlink" title="How to find icons:Iconfinder"></a>How to find icons:<a href="https://www.iconfinder.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Iconfinder</a></h2><p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/nMjQBjI.jpg!web" alt="">On the other hand, sometimes you need pre-made icons - say, social media icons - that all have a similar aesthetic. In that case, look to a website like Iconfinder instead of trying to make your own. They offer a mix of free and paid icons, as well as subscriptions, so there are various options to fit your budget.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-get-color-palette-inspiration-Coolors-co"><a href="#How-to-get-color-palette-inspiration-Coolors-co" class="headerlink" title="How to get color palette inspiration:Coolors.co"></a>How to get color palette inspiration:<a href="https://coolors.co/" target="_blank" rel="external">Coolors.co</a></h2><p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/6vQZjaB.jpg!web" alt="">You’ve created that basic postcard, but it needs more color. So where in the Pantone universe do you start? Whether you’re taking your cues from an existing palette or building them from scratch, Coolors offers inspiration via a website, iOS app, Adobe add-on, and Chrome extension. Its strangely addicting color palette generator changes out swatches at the simple touch of a space bar, and you can input your existing brand colors to get complementary suggestions. You can also browse pre-created color palettes in a different tab.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-figure-out-a-color-code-ColorZilla"><a href="#How-to-figure-out-a-color-code-ColorZilla" class="headerlink" title="How to figure out a color code:ColorZilla"></a>How to figure out a color code:<a href="http://www.colorzilla.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">ColorZilla</a></h2><p><img src="http://img1.tuicool.com/AvUJ3iz.jpg!web" alt="">This extension for Chrome and Firefox will tell you the precise six-number hex code for any pixel on a website. It even saves the history of color swatches you’ve picked, which is very helpful if you’re browsing the web and see a color you like that you want to save quickly.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-figure-out-a-font-WhatFont"><a href="#How-to-figure-out-a-font-WhatFont" class="headerlink" title="How to figure out a font:WhatFont"></a>How to figure out a font:<a href="http://whatfontapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">WhatFont</a></h2><p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/Vbuq6fA.jpg!web" alt="">Similar to how ColorZilla lets you select a pixel and tells you the color code, WhatFont lets you hover over a font anywhere on a website page, and it will automatically pull the font name from the HTML code. You can add it as extension to Chrome and Safari or download the bookmarklet; it’s also available as an iPhone and iPad app.</p>
<p>And finally, one bonus piece of design wisdom…</p>
<h2 id="When-to-hire-a-designer"><a href="#When-to-hire-a-designer" class="headerlink" title="When to hire a designer"></a>When to hire a designer</h2><p>You might be able to make passable little graphics on your own if you already have brand guidelines, color codes, fonts, etc. in place. But trust me, to create a consistent look for your brand - not to mention design larger, more complex pieces like eBooks, infographics, print collateral, or interactive content - hire an experienced designer to make you look polished. The big jobs require<a href="http://www.rightsourcemarketing.com/content-creation/6-ways-get-best-work-design-team/" target="_blank" rel="external">talented designers</a>, and you’ll just frustrate yourself if you try to take on more complicated projects without the proper training.</p>
<p>In a pinch, these nine tools will help you create small but quality design projects, even if you’re not a designer. Just be sure to turn to your graphic designer for larger jobs, or you’ll regret it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines have been the core of the company’s design philosophy ever since the Macintosh in 1978. Apple design evangelist Mike Stern gave an overview of the ever-evolving guidelines during a Wednesday session at the company’s Worldwide Developers Conference.</p>
<p>The session, entitled “</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/802/" target="_blank" rel="external">Essential Design Principles</a></p>
<p>,” is one of my favorites, in large part because I’m a designer myself. I’ve distilled the essential Apple design principles he talked about in the sketchnotes above.</p>
<h3 id="Apple-design-An-emphasis-on-‘human’"><a href="#Apple-design-An-emphasis-on-‘human’" class="headerlink" title="Apple design: An emphasis on ‘human’"></a>Apple design: An emphasis on ‘human’</h3><p>Apple choses “human interface” rather than the more frequently used term “user interface” for a reason. “Human” is the expression of our highest and most noble qualities.</p>
<p>Many of these Apple design principles might seem obvious, yet they often get neglected. We see this failure in apps that do not meet our expectations. The apps that ignore essential design principles are the ones that get used once and then deleted.</p>
<p>Apple wants to change that. The company increased the number of design sessions at WWDC this year, illustrating a deep commitment to helping developers create well-designed apps.</p>
<p>The Essential Design Principles session provided real-world experiences to reinforce the concepts discussed. The examples showed how decisions affect app design.</p>
<h3 id="Well-designed-apps-create-a-delightful-experience"><a href="#Well-designed-apps-create-a-delightful-experience" class="headerlink" title="Well-designed apps create a delightful experience"></a>Well-designed apps create a delightful experience</h3><p>Apps with simple workflows, clear interfaces and helpful information create a delightful experience.</p>
<p>The collection of Apple Human Interface Guidelines for all of the company’s operating systems (macOS, watchOS, iOS and tvOS) can be found on the<a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/" target="_blank" rel="external">Apple Developer website</a>. You can download design resources for Adobe Photoshop and Sketch in<a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/" target="_blank" rel="external">Apple’s design resources section</a>.</p>

<p>Figuring out how to organize your marketing stack is almost like putting together a 1,000 piece blank jigsaw puzzle — impossible.</p>
<p>A Q1 ‘17 survey by<a href="https://www.cmocouncil.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">CMO Council</a>and<a href="http://www.redpoint.net/" target="_blank" rel="external">RedPoint Global</a>revealed only 3% of respondents felt all of their automation, engagement and deployment tools were fully connected, with data, metrics and insights traveling freely between different technologies.</p>
<p>This stat was staggering to me. Rather than just sit on my hands I’ve put together this infographic, which will help marketers better make sense on how to potentially organize these tools and get closer to achieving cross-channel marketing nirvana.</p>
<p><img src="http://img1.tuicool.com/vU3AZ3f.png!web" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Organize and focus your team:</strong></p>
<p>You need a team that is organized and led at the level of the New England Patriots. Both your quant marketers and creative teams need systems and processes that help foster trust, harmony, commitment, accountability and orientation towards results (check out<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Dysfunctions_of_a_Team" target="_blank" rel="external">The 5 Dysfunctions of Team</a>for more). Marketing specific collaboration tools are taking stabs at addressing these needs and should be incorporated into how you organize your teams.</p>
<p><strong>Know your message:</strong></p>
<p>It’s very easy to get lost in all the process and organization of marketing and totally lose track of the appropriate message you should be communicating to your target customer. Don’t fall into this trap! Put content first as all the effort you put into everything else will be wasted if you fail in crafting the right message. There are a lot of tools that can help you work through the content creation process.</p>

<p>_Create one centralized view of the customer and apply analytics, data science and orchestration against it_so you can enable advanced communication.<strong>This is the heart of integrating most of your tools.</strong>Create sophisticated automation orchestrating messages within and across channels. Keep in mind your approach should allow for 1 to 1, 1 to many and 1 to all forms of messaging.</p>
<p>At Upfront,<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cordial-secures-6m-series-upfront-133238559.html" target="_blank" rel="external">we recently invested in Cordial</a>which aims to take this approach allowing marketers to take disparate data sources and create advanced marketing automation campaigns across all the dominant messaging channels in this type of manner. It’s something that’s been incredibly difficult to do with legacy systems until now.</p>
<p><strong>Master the basic channels first:</strong></p>
<p>While there are many exciting new types of marketing campaigns to drive growth, core channels such as<strong>email</strong>,<strong>social</strong>,<strong>web, search</strong>and<strong>offline</strong>still should be the main centers of focus for marketers. Be careful about getting distracted by next gen tactics like chatbots or VR if you haven’t even figured out the simple channels of reach.</p>
<p><strong>Always be testing:</strong></p>
<p>Invest in tools that test and optimize the performance of existing channels. You should always be searching for incremental lift in every tactic and tool you employ. If you fail in creating a test driven culture it will be very difficult to understand whether some of your new initiatives are really helping or hurting.</p>

<p><strong>Wow the customer:</strong></p>
<p>Focus on the customer experience and strive to make it a magical one. Leverage all data and insights available in order to delight the customer. However, don’t be afraid from time to time to take radical chances by throwing all customer feedback out the door and surprise them with something transformational that they never would expect. Its those types of moments that separate good marketers from great ones.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this survey is just that — a survey (it’s a lot in some places and over-simplified in others). How you will digest all of this information will, in part, depend upon your expertise. If you’re just starting out, take it slow and don’t get overwhelmed. If you’re an expert, send along some feedback on how this can be improved (there’s an interactive version coming!).</p>
<p>What’s important to remember is that there has never been a more exciting time to be a marketer — and technology is playing a pivotal part in fostering better relationships with customers.</p>
