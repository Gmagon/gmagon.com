<p>This year at VidCon, YouTube shared some new metrics that really drive home how much its dominating mobile video usage and how quickly its service is gaining viewers on TVs.</p>
<p>The highlight was the fact that there are now 1.5 billion logged-in users visiting the site every month. The distinction is important as there are undoubtedly still quite a few folks hopping on YouTube that aren’t necessarily using Google Accounts to do so.</p>
<p>The site announced it hit 1 billion monthly active users in 2013, though that number assumedly related to all visitors, logged-in and not.</p>
<p>Logged-in users spend an average of_<strong> over one hour per day</strong>_watching YouTube just on mobile devices, a pretty daunting number that showcases just how pervasive video has gotten on the mobile web.</p>
<p>“When we compare that [metric] to TV, people — in some countries like the US — watch up to four hours per day so we think there’s lots of room to get people to watch even more YouTube,” CEO Susan Wojcicki said onstage.</p>
<p>On that note, the company said that the TV screen was their fastest growing medium of consumption, noting that the category was growing 90% year-over-year, something that the company’s new YouTube TV service is undoubtedly going to add to. The company didn’t have any new details to share on desktop video viewing habits.</p>
<p>While sites like Facebook begin to throw more resources behind video efforts, it’s clear that regardless of the arbitrary “view” statistics thrown around, the sheer amount of time spent engaging with a service is a constant metric and one that YouTube has a lot to say about.</p>

    <title>Is 30 Years Old GIF Still Popular Now?</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Several days ago,  Facebook has been celebrated the 30 years birthday to the most popular image format-GIF. GIF born on June 15, 1987 which stands a big step up from its old black-and-white graphics. </p>
<p>Maybe you cannot comprehend what actually GIF is, but you must familiar with this: </p>
<p><img src="/assets/bXQNq_s-200x150.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>That’s right, memes in your phone is made of GIF format, which you always use when talking with someone in your social network and can’t stop using it, just as following:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/text-messages_o_295497.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Memes has been popular just  in recent years, but GIF is ancient in the Web, maybe older than you…</p>
<p>There has been a haunting question about GIF is how to pronounce it.</p>
<p>some say it it pronounced with a soft G, like “jiff.” Others with a hard G, like “ghiff.” </p>
<p>Fortunately, most dictionaries accept both pronunciations as correct. So you can read it as what you want.</p>
<p>GIF has a rival, called APNG or animated PNG, “it is a high quality animated image format complete with full alpha channel and graceful degradation has been available and usable since 2004.” The major advantage of APNG versus an animated GIF is image quality. APNGs simply look better, especially on a wider variety of backgrounds, and there’s already support baked into both Firefox and Opera; Chrome users can <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/apng/ehkepjiconegkhpodgoaeamnpckdbblp?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="external">download an extension</a> to support APNG files.</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/YZBjiu.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The good news is you can easily convert you GIF files to APNG through the free tool: </p>

<p>Maybe we should feel grateful for those GIF or memes that brings much happiness to us.</p>

<h2 id="12-Factors-to-Cloud-Success"><a href="#12-Factors-to-Cloud-Success" class="headerlink" title="12 Factors to Cloud Success"></a>12 Factors to Cloud Success</h2><p>Posted byRafael Benevides onJune 22, 2017June 19, 2017</p>
<p>Hey, developers! Do you care about using the best practices to apply your application to the cloud? If so then you should be using<a href="https://12factor.net/" target="_blank" rel="external">The 12-factor App</a>, which is a methodology for building software-as-a-service. Today I like to talk about the 12-factor App, which I had presented to a group at the Red Hat Summit last month.</p>
<p>Every developer that is moving their application to the cloud will face a different environment than what they are used to, their datacenter or own premise and that’s why they should care about the 12-factor methodology. This 12 step methodology was created by Heroku, which is a cloud provider who found a common solution to most of what their customers were experiencing and decided to release these solutions as a methodology. These 12 factors are intended to solve problems related to applications running in the cloud. If there was one key takeaway from my session it was not the idea to have the audience memorize these 12 factors but to have an understanding of why each one is important.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Codebase</strong><br>– use version control, one codebase tracked in revision control for many deployments.</li>
<li><strong>Dependencies</strong><br>– use a package manager and don’t commit dependencies in the codebase repository.</li>
<li><strong>Config</strong><br>– store the config in Environment Variable, if you have to repackage your application, you’re doing it wrong.</li>
<li><strong>Backing Services</strong><br>– a<br><a href="https://12factor.net/codebase" target="_blank" rel="external">deploy</a><br>of the twelve-factor app should be able to swap out a local MySQL database with one managed by a third party (such as<br><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/rds/" target="_blank" rel="external">Amazon RDS</a><br>) without any changes to the app’s code.</li>
<li><strong>Build, Release, Run</strong><br>– the twelve-factor app uses strict separation between the build, release, and run stages. Every release should always have a unique release ID and releases should allow rollback.</li>
<li><strong>Processes</strong><br>– execute the app as one or more stateless processes, the Twelve-factor processes are stateless and<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_nothing_architecture" target="_blank" rel="external">share-nothing</a><br>.</li>
<li><strong>Port Binding</strong><br>– export services via port binding, The twelve-factor app is completely self-contained.</li>
<li><strong>Concurrency</strong><br>– scale out via the process model. Each process should be individually scaled, with Factor 6 (Stateless), it is easy to scale the services.</li>
<li><strong>Disposability</strong><br>– maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown, we can achieve this with containers.</li>
<li><strong>Dev/Prod Parity</strong><br>– Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible, the twelve-factor app is designed for<br><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/02/continuous-deployment.html" target="_blank" rel="external">continuous deployment</a><br>by keeping the gap between development and production small.</li>
<li><strong>Logs</strong><br>– treat logs as event streams, a twelve-factor app never concerns itself with routing or storage of its output stream.</li>
<li><strong>Admin Processes</strong><br>– run admin/management tasks as one-off processes.</li>
</ol>
<p>The 12-factor App methodology is technology and language agnostic but satisfied by<a href="https://developers.redhat.com/containers/" target="_blank" rel="external">Containers</a>,<a href="https://developers.redhat.com/microservices/" target="_blank" rel="external">Microservices</a>, and CI/CD Pipelines with a focus on<a href="https://developers.redhat.com/devops/" target="_blank" rel="external">DevOps</a>.You can access more information on The 12-factor Appat<a href="https://12factor.net/" target="_blank" rel="external">https://12factor.net/</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Whether you are new to Containers or have experience, downloading this</strong><a href="https://developers.redhat.com/promotions/docker-cheatsheet/" target="_blank" rel="external"><strong>cheat sheet</strong></a><strong>can assist you when encountering tasks you haven’t done lately.</strong></p>

    <title>Face Recognition in R</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>(This article was first published on<a href="https://www.stoltzmaniac.com/facial-recognition-in-r/" target="_blank" rel="external"><strong>R-Projects – Stoltzmaniac</strong></a>, and kindly contributed toR-bloggers)</p>
<h3 id="Face-Recognition-in-R"><a href="#Face-Recognition-in-R" class="headerlink" title="Face Recognition in R"></a>Face Recognition in R</h3><p>OpenCV is an incredibly powerful tool to have in your toolbox. I have had a lot of success using it in Python but very little success in R. I haven’t done too much other than searching Google but it seems as if “imager” and “videoplayR” provide a lot of the functionality but not all of it.</p>
<p>I have never actually called Python functions from R before. Initially, I tried the “rPython” library – that has a lot of advantages, but was completely unnecessary for me so system() worked absolutely fine. While this example is extremely simple, it should help to illustrate how easy it is to utilize the power of Python from within R. I need to give credit to Harrison Kinsley for all of his efforts and work at<a href="https://www.pythonprogramming.net/" target="_blank" rel="external">PythonProgramming.net</a>– I used a lot of his code and ideas for this post (especially the Python portion).</p>
<p>Using videoplayR I created a function which would take a picture with my webcam and save it as “originalWebcamShot.png”</p>
<p>Note:saving images and then loading them isn’t very efficient but works in this case and is extremely easy to implement. It saves us from passing variables, functions, objects, and/or methods between R and Python in this case.</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/vayqquF.png!web" alt=""></p>
<p>I’ll trace my steps backward through this post (I think it’s easier to understand what’s going on in this case).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Given an array of <strong>n </strong>distinct integers and an element <strong>x</strong>. Search the element <strong>x </strong>in the array using minimum number of comparisons. Any sort of comparison will contribute 1 to the count of comparisons. For example, the condition used to terminate a loop, will also contribute 1 to the count of comparisons each time it gets executed. Expressions like <strong>while (n) {n–;} </strong>also contribute to the count of comparisons as value of <strong>n </strong>is being compared internally so as to decide whether or not to terminate the loop.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>

<p>How to reduce number of comparisons?</p>
<p>The idea is to copy x (element to be searched) to last location so that one last comparison when x is not present in arr[] is saved.</p>

<p>Being agile is cool. You do it because, hey, everybody is agile now – or at least they seem to be. I guess you’ve got familiar with the fun procedures, read three articles, convinced your team members and BOOM! You’re doing it. Or, are you?</p>
<h2 id="Adapt-not-adopt"><a href="#Adapt-not-adopt" class="headerlink" title="Adapt, not adopt"></a>Adapt, not adopt</h2><p>I had a beer with one of my project manager friends recently. As the topic of work came up, she started complaining about her company’s Scrum method. She said it was too inflexible and had been causing more frustration than benefits. I had asked how they used it and she replied:</p>
<p>“We adopted it from a book.”</p>
<p>Adopting a process is not the best way to do things. Try to adapt it instead. Dig deep and find your challenges. Set up a research plan to reveal pain points. Involve stakeholders, interview your team members, and continuously improve how you manage projects. These are just a few things that can be missed along the way.</p>
<h2 id="‘Computer-define-Challenges’"><a href="#‘Computer-define-Challenges’" class="headerlink" title="‘Computer define: Challenges’"></a>‘Computer define: Challenges’</h2><p>Let’s go back to the beginning. First things first, I recommend researching the crap out of the challenges. Feels too basic? Yes, but it is necessary to set a purpose for a new process created from scratch. And it helps focus on intents, as<a href="https://hackerchick.com/are-we-agile-yet/" target="_blank" rel="external">Abby Fichtner states</a>in her article.</p>
<p>So, break down every thought until you find your main challenges. Here’s a silly little example:</p>
<ul>
<li>What pains does your team have?</li>
<li>They do a lot of overtime</li>
<li>How come?</li>
<li>Our clients say we don’t work enough.</li>
<li>Why do they say that?</li>
<li>They haven’t received any outcome for months.</li>
<li>What are you going to do about it?</li>
<li>I want my team to provide deliverables on a weekly basis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do interviews with team members. Ask more than one “why”. Empathize with them to learn what their pain points are, what they’re good at and what they hate the most. Learn how they do certain tasks they have problems with. And report everything you find.</p>
<p>If your company is far too big to talk to everyone, talk to the key people with the most pieces of information. Find their incentives and invite them to take part in the ideation process. Finding the purpose of agile together could help kickstart the collaboration.</p>
<p>Hard to convince C-level? You might want to know what each stakeholder’s desires are. Try to hire an agile professional who explains the benefits to them. Straightforward communication is also a key here.</p>
<p>Also, collect what you already have to form a foundation. Why change something that works? This way it’s easier to find what the missing parts are.</p>
<p><img src="http://img1.tuicool.com/Qb2Q7jJ.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="Design-your-own-agile-process"><a href="#Design-your-own-agile-process" class="headerlink" title="Design your own agile process"></a>Design your own agile process</h2><p>Here comes the fun part. As you are now aware of what you have and what you want to achieve, you can start looking for tools to reach your goals. If they match your statements, try to adapt them for your team. Don’t worry: none of them are as hard as they look.</p>
<h4 id="Using-our-example-above"><a href="#Using-our-example-above" class="headerlink" title="Using our example above:"></a>Using our example above:</h4><ul>
<li>If regular deliverables are important to you, try to use<br>story points<br>from Scrum. This way you can slice up your tasks.</li>
<li>If you deliver new features regularly, but usage statistics do not get better, try to focus more on product discovery and solve people’s real problems instead of fast feature building.</li>
<li>Weekly client meetings<br>can help demonstrate your presence. “Hey, we’re here! Here are the things we’ve done since last week.”</li>
<li>Daily standups<br>could be also useful to track your team’s progress and difficulties.</li>
<li>A five-hour weekly<br>sprint planning<br>seems to be overkill if you want to focus on fast deliverables.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to do everything as a team. It’s not a one-man workshop: you can only change your organization’s processes if you do it together. Sit down with everyone responsible for the change and let them be part of the work.</p>
<p>If you have the opportunity to experiment with your team, do it as soon as possible. I’d suggest remaining modular: if something seems to be working, do it. If something causes more pain than gain after a few months, get rid of it.<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/doing-ux-agile-world/" target="_blank" rel="external">Hola Loranger says</a>that process gradually gets more perfect with practice. You’ll gain experience along the way after the risky start.</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/vQv2Arv.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="Set-a-framework"><a href="#Set-a-framework" class="headerlink" title="Set a framework"></a>Set a framework</h2><p>The biggest thing I’ve learned from my failures is that I need to write down everything. Yes, even that little half-thought! Then I structure and map my thoughts and show them to others.</p>
<p>A good framework starts with collaboration after the first thoughts are born. At<a href="https://uxstudioteam.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">UX Studio</a>, we use internal “How We Work” meetings to develop our processes. We take a poll with topics to decide which we want to deal with. After choosing the topic, we divide into smaller groups and ideate. At the end, we share it with each other and decide on the next steps. Sometimes we organize an education session or more How We Work meetings if needed.</p>
<p>Write a handy document of your process, even if it only consists of three bullet points at the beginning. If you have the same three points a few months later, well, you’re a superhero then! This way, there’s always a document to rely on in case you forget something. And it’s also handy if a new member joins the team.</p>
<p><strong>What is a good framework like?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Simple and easy to use</li>
<li>Defined jointly with the team</li>
<li>Written down with concise wording and bullet points</li>
<li>Everyone knows it and uses it naturally</li>
<li>Always available for everyone in the team</li>
<li>Improved and refined regularly</li>
<li>May contain pieces of best practices from other organizations</li>
<li>Explained and shared with new team members</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are the elements of an agile product management framework?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Product discovery: How do you explore the pains and needs of your customers systematically? What do you do with the findings?</li>
<li>Team structure and task break-down: Who works together, and how do you distribute the tasks and responsibilities between your team? How will different people work together (for example, devs and designers)?</li>
<li>Strategy and roadmaps: When do you refresh your product strategy? How do you involve others in this process? How do you share the results with everyone?</li>
<li>Measure: How will you measure the team’s and the product’s performance? What qualitative and quantitative methods will you use?</li>
<li>Learn: How will your team learn from its experience? How and when will you update your methods together?</li>
<li>Stakeholders: How will you share your efforts with shareholders and involve them in strategic decisions?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Is-it-worth-it"><a href="#Is-it-worth-it" class="headerlink" title="Is it worth it?"></a>Is it worth it?</h2><p>We at<a href="https://uxstudioteam.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">UX Studio</a>use our own design process, adapted to each project and fine-tuned for the product itself. We’ve built it on several agile processes, but we’ve changed it fundamentally so that it works best with small project teams. We iterate once a week, and research in every phase from the beginning. And I can tell it saves more time and money than you can imagine.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be bulletproof unless we frequently measured and revised it. If you feel that your process is still chaotic but you can see the “grid of thoughts”, that’s absolutely okay. In my opinion, that’s the sign of continuous monitoring and changing. So, yes, it’s worth the time.</p>
<h4 id="As-a-tiny-takeaway"><a href="#As-a-tiny-takeaway" class="headerlink" title="As a tiny takeaway:"></a>As a tiny takeaway:</h4><ol>
<li>Research your team thoroughly</li>
<li>Establish statements</li>
<li>Find the best tools</li>
<li>Write down what you do</li>
<li>Refine continuously</li>
</ol>

<p>Facebook is introducing a new feature to give users peace of mind around how their profile photo can be used and accessed by others.</p>
<p>The social network today<a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/06/giving-people-more-control-over-their-facebook-profile-picture/" target="_blank" rel="external">announced</a>a pilot program in India that is designed to protect users who are concerned about other people gaining access to their profile image. The new ‘photo guard’ feature has a range of safety measures that include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preventing other users from downloading a person’s profile pic, or sharing it with others</li>
<li>Preventing other users from tagging other people in a person’s profile pic</li>
<li>Preventing other users from taking screenshots of a person’s profile pic — although this is initially for the Android app only</li>
</ul>
<p>When activated, the optional guard is visible through a blue border and shield around a user’s profile pic. The company partnered with an Indian illustrator to make these safety controls more compelling with attractively designed options.</p>
<p>The new feature is driven by research that the company undertook in India. In a blogpost, Facebook explained that it found that “some women choose not to share profile pictures that include their faces anywhere on the internet because they’re concerned about what may happen to their photos.”</p>
<p>It believes this solution may go some way to helping, and it said that early tests indicate that people are 75 percent less likely to copy a photo when the guard option is enabled.</p>
<p>This rollout is initially happening in India, but Facebook said it hopes to expand it to other countries “soon.”</p>

<p>Travis Kalanick.</p>
<p>Travis Kalanick stepped down Tuesday as chief executive of Uber, the ride-hailing service that he helped found in 2009 and that he built into a transportation colossus, after a shareholder revolt made it untenable for him to stay on at the company.</p>
<p>Mr. Kalanick’s exit came under pressure after hours of drama involving Uber’s investors, according to two people with knowledge of the situation, who asked to remain anonymous because the details are confidential.</p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday, five of Uber’s major investors demanded that the chief executive resign immediately. The investors included one of Uber’s biggest shareholders, the venture capital firm Benchmark, which has one of its partners, Bill Gurley, on Uber’s board. The investors made their demand for Mr. Kalanick to resign in a letter delivered to the chief executive while he was in Chicago, said the people with knowledge of the situation.</p>
<p>More from the New York Times:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/12/technology/uber-chief-travis-kalanick-stock-buyback.html" target="_blank" rel="external">How Uber’s chief is gaining even more clout in the company</a></p>
<p>In the letter, titled “Moving Uber Forward” and obtained by The New York Times, the investors wrote to Mr. Kalanick that he must immediately leave and that the company needed a change in leadership. Mr. Kalanick, 40, consulted with at least one Uber board member and after hours of discussions with some of the investors, he agreed to step down. He will remain on Uber’s board of directors.</p>
<p>“I love Uber more than anything in the world and at this difficult moment in my personal life I have accepted the investors request to step aside so that Uber can go back to building rather than be distracted with another fight,” Mr. Kalanick said in a statement.</p>
<p>The move caps months of questions over the leadership of Uber, which has become a prime example of Silicon Valley start-up culture gone awry. The company has been exposed this year as having a workplace culture that is rife with sexual harassment and discrimination, and has pushed the envelope in dealing with law enforcement and even partners. That tone was set by Mr. Kalanick, who has aggressively turned the company into the world’s dominant ride-hailing service and upended the transportation industry around the globe.</p>
<p>Mr. Kalanick’s troubles began earlier this year after a former Uber engineer detailed what she said was sexual harassment at the company, opening the floodgates for more complaints and spurring internal investigations. In addition, Uber has been dealing with an intellectual property lawsuit from Waymo, the self-driving car business that operates under Google’s parent company, and a federal inquiry into a software tool that Uber used to sidestep some law enforcement.</p>
<p>Uber has been trying to move past its difficult history, which has grown inextricably tied to Mr. Kalanick. In recent months, Uber has fired more than 20 employees after an investigation into the company’s culture, embarked on major changes to professionalize its workplace, and is searching for new executives including a chief operating officer.</p>
<p>Mr. Kalanick last week said he would take an indefinite leave of absence from Uber, partly to work on himself and to grieve for his mother, who died last month in a boating accident. He said Uber’s day-to-day management would fall to a committee of more than 10 executives.</p>
<p>But the shareholder letter indicates that his taking time off was not enough for some investors who have pumped millions of dollars into the ride-hailing company, which has seen its valuation swell to nearly $70 billion. For them, Mr. Kalanick had to go.</p>
<p>The five shareholders who demanded Mr. Kalanick’s resignation include some of the technology industry’s most prestigious venture capital firms, which invested in Uber at an early stage of the company’s life, as well as a mutual fund firm. Apart from Benchmark, they are First Round Capital, Lowercase Capital, Menlo Ventures and Fidelity Investments, which together own more than a quarter of Uber’s stock. Because some of the investors hold a type of stock that endows them with an outsize number of votes, they have about 40 percent of Uber’s voting power.</p>
<p>Mr. Kalanick’s resignation opens questions of who may take over Uber, especially since the company has been so molded in his image. And Mr. Kalanick will probably remain a presence there since he still retains control of a majority of Uber’s voting shares.</p>
<p>Taking a start-up chief executive to task so publicly is relatively unusual in Silicon Valley, where investors often praise entrepreneurs and their aggressiveness, especially if their companies are growing fast. It is only when those start-ups are in a precarious position or are declining that shareholders move to protect their investment.</p>
<p>In the case of Uber — one of the most highly valued private companies in the world — investors could lose billions of dollars if the company were to be marked down in valuation.</p>
<p>Uber, which has raised more than $11 billion from investors since its founding in 2009, has a wide base of shareholders apart from the ones who signed the letter. Uber’s investors also include TPG Capital, the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, mutual fund giants like BlackRock and wealthy clients of firms like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>In the letter, in addition to Mr. Kalanick’s immediate resignation, the five shareholders asked for improved oversight of the company’s board by filling two of three empty board seats with “truly independent directors.” They also demanded that Mr. Kalanick support a board-led search committee for a new chief executive, and that Uber immediately hire an experienced chief financial officer.</p>

<p>One of the ways I feed<a href="https://www.inc.com/nicolas-cole/the-4-biggest-obstacles-all-new-entrepreneurs-face-and-how-these-4-young-entrepr.html" target="_blank" rel="external">my own learning process as a young entrepreneur</a>is by learning from those above or ahead of me on the path. I am constantly looking for new people to learn from, eager to hear what solutions they found for themselves (and selfishly, how I might avoid those same challenges in the future).</p>
<p>But “success” isn’t just about achievement. In fact, the most successful companies don’t just measure the end result, the total revenue, but the process that got them that result. Efficiency and good habits are equally (if not more) important.</p>
<p>So, what do some of those good habits look like?</p>
<h2 id="Pillar-Number-1-“Cash-is-King”"><a href="#Pillar-Number-1-“Cash-is-King”" class="headerlink" title="Pillar Number 1: “Cash is King”"></a>Pillar Number 1: “Cash is King”</h2><p>A difficult concept made simple, “Cash is King” is the mantra every business (and business leader) should live by.</p>
<p>“You can’t run a business on the promise of cash or future payment. It is the only metric that really matters and should be the primary measure of your company’s success at every stage,” said Aaron Webber, CEO of<a href="http://madisonwall.co/#home" target="_blank" rel="external">MadisonWall</a>, a venture capital firm and holding company to a handful of creative agencies. “A million dollars in outstanding invoices looks great and all, but it won’t help you if you can’t pay next week’s rent. You need to have physical cash in the bank set aside for when those inevitable obstacles arise.”</p>
<p>He went on to explain that a successful company is one that practices fiscal prudence and understands the power of compounding interest and investing back into the business. If you can develop and maintain good spending habits with this in mind, you won’t just sustain your business, you will grow it. And if not, then your business has little chance of survival. Unfortunately, money won’t fix bad habits. In fact, it might make them worse.</p>
<h2 id="Pillar-Number-2-Leadership-that-isn’t-ego-driven"><a href="#Pillar-Number-2-Leadership-that-isn’t-ego-driven" class="headerlink" title="Pillar Number 2: Leadership that isn’t ego driven."></a>Pillar Number 2: Leadership that isn’t ego driven.</h2><p>Too often, I see young entrepreneurs get overly excited about what they’re going to call themselves, and who gets to put the title of “CEO” in their Twitter bio–now that they’ve made a website and decided on a name for their “company.”</p>
<p>I know I’m not the first person to say this, and I know I won’t be the last. But it is an interesting thing to observe in my peers, and those who are ambitious about starting big companies. I see them spending more time on what title they want to wear, rather than how they’re going to actually build something of value.</p>
<p>“If you truly want to build a loyal team, you have to realize that it’s not all about you. Especially as the CEO, your job isn’t to be the center of attention. Your job is to make everyone else’s lives easier, and give them the opportunity to do great work. You’re the facilitator, the coach, not necessarily the star player,” said<a href="http://themfceo.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Andy Frisella</a>, CEO of 1st Phorm International.</p>
<h2 id="Pillar-Number-3-Productivity-can’t-be-chained-to-a-cubicle"><a href="#Pillar-Number-3-Productivity-can’t-be-chained-to-a-cubicle" class="headerlink" title="Pillar Number 3: Productivity can’t be chained to a cubicle."></a>Pillar Number 3: Productivity can’t be chained to a cubicle.</h2><p>This is a hot topic for the companies of today, this idea of open work environments and allowing for more employee freedom.</p>
<p>Jim Kwik, founder and CEO of<a href="https://kwiklearning.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Kwik Learning</a>, has served as the mental coach to some of the world’s leading CEOs and celebrities. On the topic of productivity and brain fitness in the workplace, he said, “We are becoming more and more aware that working 8 straight hours, 5 days a week, might not be the most productive method for maximum efficiency. In fact, many companies are starting to realize that by being more flexible, and allowing their employees more freedom, they will actually produce better work. It just might not happen within the hours of 9-5. And you know what? That’s OK.”</p>
<p>Especially for new leaders and founders, it can be easy to fall into the trap of thinking that hours-in is the best measure for productivity or success. But the truth is, it’s not. In fact, a lot of today’s business leaders are operating more under the belief that hours-in is a poor metric, and the only thing that matters is the final product. If you do it in half the time while working from home, great. Just get it done, and get it done well.</p>
<h2 id="Pillar-Number-4-Your-customer-service-can’t-suck"><a href="#Pillar-Number-4-Your-customer-service-can’t-suck" class="headerlink" title="Pillar Number 4: Your customer service can’t suck."></a>Pillar Number 4: Your customer service can’t suck.</h2><p>Customer acquisition is hard. Customer retention is even harder.</p>
<p>If you have a high churn rate as a company, you’re going to find yourself constantly struggling to build something successful over the long term. What you’re looking for is repeat, happy customers, ideally the kind that then go on to recommend you to their friends.</p>
<p>This is the advice that Charles Zhong, CEO of<a href="https://www.azazie.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Azazie</a>, shared. Azazie has made a name for themselves in the bridal fashion world by disrupting the conventional industry, seeing 300% sales growth in 2017. Oh, and for those that say Millennials are impossible to deal with as employees, the average age of the company’s employees is 27.</p>
<p>“If you want to see what customer service looks like, step inside the world of bridal fashion. Consumers are tremendously particular, and you as a company are dealing with a very important occasion: someone’s wedding. In order for your internal team to work effectively, you have to communicate in a way that allows all parties to call out what isn’t working so that it can be fixed. We encourage our team members to ask questions, ask what people are struggling with, what needs more clarification or process, etc. We want everyone to feel heard,” said Zhong.</p>
<p>He went on to explain that, on the flipside, customer service that goes above and beyond is all about being personable. People already have the Internet to answer most questions. So when a customer reaches out, sometimes they just need a human to walk them through their specific case. The more human and personable that experience feels, the more likely that customer will be to return, because they trust you.</p>

<p>Bloomberg via Getty Images</p>
<p>Apple and IKEA are creating an AR app that will let customers preview how an item will look in their home. Michael Valdsgaard, IKEA’s digital transformation manager, told Swedish website<a href="http://digital.di.se/artikel/ikea-om-samarbetet-med-apple-superintressant-for-oss" target="_blank" rel="external"><em>Digital.di</em></a>, “This will be the first augmented reality app that allows you to make reliable buying decisions.”</p>
<p>In the first version, customers will take photos of their homes and use the app to place<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016/04/05/ikea-htc-vive-kitchen-vr-app/" target="_blank" rel="external">images</a>of IKEA products wherever they might want them. Valdsgaard said users will be able to position products with millimeter precision and sizing of the products will be to scale. Eventually, customers may be able to try out products and then order them through the app.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/06/08/ikea-mars-simulator-teenage-engineering/" target="_blank" rel="external">IKEA</a>catalog app sort of lets you do this now, but not with much accuracy. In it, you can click on a piece of furniture and see it superimposed over whatever your camera is pointed towards. You can drag the furniture around and get an idea of what it might look like in your home and you can even use the app to make sure the size is accurate. But Valdsgaard says the new app will be better with the help of<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014/09/07/ikea-apple-ad-parody/" target="_blank" rel="external">Apple’s</a>technology and experience with AR.</p>
<p>IKEA isn’t the only retail company with AR shopping experiences. Both<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016/06/09/lowes-tango-ar-app/" target="_blank" rel="external">Lowe’s</a>and<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/20/pottery-barn-ar-app/" target="_blank" rel="external">Pottery Barn</a>have apps that let you get an idea of how furniture and appliances will look in your home. Lowe’s even uses AR to help customers navigate their stores and<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/14/lowe-s-is-using-ar-and-vr-to-make-how-to-easier/" target="_blank" rel="external">VR</a>to give lessons on how to successfully complete certain home improvement projects.</p>
<p>Valdsgaard says they would like to have the app available by the iOS 11 debut, but that it may not be possible. IKEA expects to have 500-600 products available on the app at launch.</p>

<p>NCAR</p>
<p>IBM’s supercomputers might soon power the weather-predicting systems of tomorrow. Through its subsidiary The Weather Company, the computing titan has partnered with the University Corporation for Academic Research (UCAR) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) to move beyond today’s regional-scale forecasting to anticipate weather at the local level…and aspire to introduce the first model that covers the whole globe.</p>
<p>Current tech forecasts massively-sized meteorological systems that influence regional weather, like snowstorms and hurricanes. The model this IBM collaboration wants to build would account for the influence smaller events (like thunderstorms) have on local weather. IBM will join with UCAR to co-design a computational solution that runs on the former’s POWER9-based systems, which are set to launch at the end of the year. The Weather Company will use this computing powerhouse to adapt NCAR’s community-weather model to a global scale and refine the longer-term predictions to make more accurate forecasts weeks or months out.</p>

<p><img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?quality=100&amp;image_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2F77cf94f0db4d4e837b7b7c41b6d3fdc3%2F205396422%2Fsignage-is-displayed-at-the-1-infinite-loop-building-ahead-of-an-inc-picture-id618582652-ed.jpg&amp;client=cbc79c14efcebee57402&amp;signature=6ee70305fcd10e133332fff6a30f307ca15f7871" alt=""></p>
<p>Michael Short/Bloomberg via Getty Images</p>
<p>For the longest time, Apple product leaks tended to come from the<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/04/24/apple-iphone-8-may-not-ship-in-september/" target="_blank" rel="external">supply chain</a>: a factory worker would<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011/01/05/iphone-5-parts-caught-on-video/" target="_blank" rel="external">send parts</a>or<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/05/15/exclusive-iphone-8-renders/" target="_blank" rel="external">a design file</a>to accessory makers eager to get a head start on their next iPhone cases. You might want to rethink that assumption. In a leaked secrecy briefing (ironic, we know) obtained by<em>The Outline</em>, Apple’s David Rice<a href="https://theoutline.com/post/1766/leaked-recording-inside-apple-s-global-war-on-leakers" target="_blank" rel="external">revealed</a>that leaks from the company’s campuses were more common in 2016 than those from suppliers. This is more a reflection of Apple’s success clamping down on third-party leaks than loose lips in Cupertino, although it does indicate that the tech giant will turn its attention inward.</p>
<p>Rice doesn’t divulge too many of Apple’s methods for countering supply chain leaks, but he notes that Apple will buy back parts to make sure they don’t reach the news: in 2013, it snapped up 19,000<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013/09/17/iphone-5c-review/" target="_blank" rel="external">iPhone 5c</a>shells before the announcement. It also screens 221 million transits (that is, people leaving or entering factories) per year, so it’s less likely that someone will walk out with an iPhone enclosure. The reduction in leaks is no mean feat given those daunting figures, especially since workers are sometimes offered juicy incentives (up to a year’s worth of salary) to smuggle parts.</p>
<p>The presentation also underscores the drastic efforts Apple takes to lock things down at home. They’re not completely draconian, but they’re bound to raise questions. Many of Apple’s anti-leak investigators, including Rice himself, come from agencies like the NSA, FBI and Secret Service – does it really need to treat an iPad leak like a matter of national security? The company will also pursue in-house leakers for<em>years</em>, and is adamant that employees avoid discussing products with family or in the more public parts of Apple’s offices. It’ll sometimes place overseers on product teams to actively prevent leaks.</p>
<p>Rice is quick to note that Apple isn’t reading emails or eavesdropping on conversations, but there’s still a sense that Apple is watching closely. Some incoming employees will delete social accounts, or take those accounts private, out of a concern that they might accidentally say too much.</p>
<p>Apple does have strong financial incentives to cut back on leaks, as they can hurt sales or reveal its product strategy to competitors. In a call discussing Apple’s<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/05/02/apple-q2-2017-earnings/" target="_blank" rel="external">spring earnings</a>, Tim Cook blamed an iPhone sales slide on unusually early and frequent leaks for the next model. However, the briefing makes it clear that Apple takes its secrecy more seriously than many other companies, and possibly too seriously. Is it really a matter of life and death that a new iPhone remains under wraps, especially since Apple’s launch schedules are fairly predictable? Apple built its modern reputation on “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/05/01/apple-siri-speaker-said-due-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="external">one more thing</a>“ surprises, but it’s not clear that spoilers are as damaging as the company thinks.</p>

    <title>What Does a Well-Documented CSS Codebase Look Like?</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the front-end community, there is a lot of attention related to documenting JavaScript. That’s not so much the case with CSS. Often times I feel like lost when I join a project with minimal or no CSS documentation.</p>
<p>Even though CSS is relatively easy to write, it can be quite hard to maintain.The specificity, the global scope of everything, and the lack of guidance can easily lead to inconsistency, code duplication, and over-complication.</p>
<p>I’ve long been curious what a really well-documented CSS codebase looks like. Here, I’ll share my experience, along with the expectations I have towards my vision of well-documented stylesheets.</p>
<p>It surprises me where I hear people say that commenting CSS is not that important. I imagine none of them have had to deal with 10,000+ line stylesheets! Often I’ve struggled with what HTML results in what specific style. Without having a solid context about the development decisions taken, debugging efforts increase.<a href="http://commadot.com/wtf-per-minute/" target="_blank" rel="external">WTFs per minute</a>increase exponentially too.</p>
<p>Many times I’ve spent hours to figure out what the developer intended, why she didn’t do it the another way, why is this layout seemingly so complex. There is much pain buried in these “why” questions.</p>
<p>So, here we go! Let’s examine the 4 big signs of a well-documented CSS codebase.</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/mE3YfiU.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="1-CSS-Tech-Stack-amp-Toolchain"><a href="#1-CSS-Tech-Stack-amp-Toolchain" class="headerlink" title="1) CSS Tech Stack &amp; Toolchain"></a>1) CSS Tech Stack &amp; Toolchain</h3><p>There are likely things as part of our CSS code base like third-party libraries, mixins, or other tools. Looking in the package manager’s dependencies list doesn’t give a lot of context_why_the decisions were made to add these things, what they do exactly, and how we’re using them.</p>
<p>It would be good for everyone to know why a certain library or tool was introduced. Imagine, for example, that a third-party library was introduced only to solve what has become an obsolete CSS issue. If we had context like that, we could make more informed decisions.</p>
<p>There sometimes can be quite a few third-party libraries in a project. Have you ever spent a bunch of time on web searching each one figuring out what it even is? It can be quite a challenge to know or to keep track of what each exactly does.</p>
<p>A well-documented codebase would include a description for each dependency. Perhaps you could the comment tweet-length (140 characters) explaining why it is there. That would give anyone else in the code base a head start on why something is there.</p>
<p>I like adding these descriptions right in the place where I<code>@import</code>them.</p>
<h3 id="2-CSS-Conventions"><a href="#2-CSS-Conventions" class="headerlink" title="2) CSS Conventions"></a>2) CSS Conventions</h3><p>Good coding conventions result in consistent, readable, and unambiguous source code. They standardize the structure and coding style of an application so that you and others can easily read and understand the code.</p>
<p>It’s important to know if there are any project-specific naming conventions or methodologies in place (likeBEM,<a href="https://css-tricks.com/on-style-maintenance/#article-header-id-2" target="_blank" rel="external">OOCSS</a>,<a href="https://smacss.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">SMACSS</a>, orACSS). I’ve seen cases where a certain methodologies principles are applied but<a href="https://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/" target="_blank" rel="external">the actual rules followed are modified based on the preferences of the developers involved</a>. So an indication how strictly we must follow the methodology principles would be good to leave in a well-documented code base.</p>
<p>This brings up the larger issue of CSS style guides. A naming convention is just one choice as part of a complete styling strategy. Other parts might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>How is code sectioned?</li>
<li>How are files structured?</li>
<li><a href="https://css-tricks.com/poll-results-how-do-you-order-your-css-properties/" target="_blank" rel="external">How are properties ordered?</a></li>
<li>How is commenting done?</li>
<li>How is the formatting done (indentation, rule declarations)?</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/airbnb/css#javascript-hooks" target="_blank" rel="external">How to bind JavaScript hooks to classes?</a></li>
<li>… and many more rules or anti-patterns like nesting more then 3 levels deep, avoiding ID selectors,<br><a href="https://css-tricks.com/when-using-important-is-the-right-choice/" target="_blank" rel="external">using !important only for utility classes</a><br>and etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>All this makes up a completeCSS style guide. Having a shared vocabulary like this I’d consider a strong plus towards consistency.</p>
<h3 id="3-CSS-Architecture"><a href="#3-CSS-Architecture" class="headerlink" title="3) CSS Architecture"></a>3) CSS Architecture</h3><p>Most scalable projects follow some type of architecture in terms of ordering styles. In a well-documented codebase, the fundamental principles that the project follows when structuring and sectioning styles should be mentioned.</p>
<p>I was first inspired to explore CSS architecture by<a href="https://youtu.be/1OKZOV-iLj4" target="_blank" rel="external">watching Harry Roberts’s talk about managing CSS projects</a>. Here’s Harry:</p>
<p>CSS architecture seems to be somewhat in vogue right now. It’s something you’ve no doubt heard mentioned numerous times over the past year or so, and with good reason: UIs (and the teams that build them) are getting bigger and more complicated than ever before.</p>
<p>There are a number of aspects of CSS which make it troublesome. It’s declarative, meaning there is no logic or control flow to tell other developers much about the state or construction of the project. It operates in a global namespace, meaning we get collisions, leaking styles and inadvertent regressions. It utilizes inheritance, making everything somewhat interdependent and brittle. Finally, the unavoidable specificity model can cause problems when selectors fight each other for prominence.</p>
<p>Therefore, he<a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/manage-large-css-projects-itcss-101517528" target="_blank" rel="external">introduces a concept for architecting CSS called ITCSS</a>. If you are working on a project of reasonable scale, chances are someone already defined similar principles or ideas that aim to resolve these problems. So in a well-documented codebase, I would expect to see them written somewhere.</p>
<p>One could tell if the architecture is explained well enough if you can answer the following question: Where should new styles or stylesheets be added?</p>
<h3 id="4-CSS-Component-Descriptions-and-Examples"><a href="#4-CSS-Component-Descriptions-and-Examples" class="headerlink" title="4) CSS Component Descriptions and Examples"></a>4) CSS Component Descriptions and Examples</h3><p>A common pattern is to separate the logical modules into CSS components (or “blocks” according to BEM). Some of them might be re-usable, some may not, but the important thing is that they are the building blocks of our project. Therefore, describing what they are should be a top priority in a well-documented codebase.</p>
<p>Ideally, you should arrange and group them, name them, and establish rules between them to generate an overview of all components. A well-described CSS component doesn’t only include information about what the component does but also has other valuable intel like example HTML markup and the context in which it’s meant to be used. Going one step further brings up the issue of<a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/taking-pattern-libraries-next-level/" target="_blank" rel="external">Pattern Libraries</a>. A pattern library is a collection of reusable components that can be used together to create a website. With modular, component-based architecture becoming a trend, they can bring huge value.</p>
<p>The goal of a pattern library is to show what can be built with existing patterns (components). But let’s take a look at what additional information can be displayed alongside each pattern also. Vitaly Friedman shared a good summary on<a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/taking-pattern-libraries-next-level/" target="_blank" rel="external">how taking the pattern library to the next level looks like</a>. He states that focusing on components isn’t good enough:</p>
<p>One of the main problems with pattern libraries is that, while they provide an overview of components, they often leave a lot open to interpretation. Components can be combined in a variety of ways, consistently and inconsistently. It’s great to be able to see what button variants and iconography are available and what kinds of tables and pricing tags one may use, but what if you need to design or build an interface that contains all of these components at once — and perhaps another that doesn’t yet exist in the library?</p>
<p>A list of modules alone wouldn’t convey any context or any specifics on how the modules should (and should not) be used.</p>
<p>Based on Vitaly’s post and<a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/anatomy-of-a-pattern-in-a-pattern-library/" target="_blank" rel="external">Brad Frost’s anatomy of a pattern in a pattern library</a>, here are a few ideas I can imagine each of our patterns (components) could have, despite the usual unique name, code sample and a description of the component’s purpose. Basic (fundamental):</p>
<ul>
<li>Tags or categories: The assigned tags or categories for the component. Developers could tag their components with “in use”, “needs refactoring” tags and etc.</li>
<li>Responsive preview: A real-life, resizable preview of the component, using the actual snippet of code being used in production. Alternatively, just a screenshot.</li>
<li>Versioning and legacy, team members involved or responsible: In a bigger team, the ownership of the (family of) components and which team members have been actively developing them could be really helpful for maintenance and further development.</li>
</ul>
<p>… and here are a few more advanced:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance impact: Sometimes CSS could be heavy too. An indicator of performance or a “warning signs” section, outlining not only performance impact but also any common mishaps when the pattern is used incorrectly.</li>
<li>Accessibility implications: Indicator of accessibility requirements. Some components might require more work to maintain accessibility, especially if they interact with other components.</li>
<li>Related patterns: A quick overview of related components or the family of components that a given component belongs to. Could use an explanation of when to use a component, when not to, and why.</li>
<li>Fallback and print previews.</li>
</ul>
<p>… the list goes on and on to whatever makes sense for your specific use-case.</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>A well-documented CSS codebase enforces consistency, boosts maintainability, and helps the team to build a shared vocabulary. It is a prerequisite for efficient CSS design and development. Moreover, based on my experience, it inevitably leads to better performance. I strongly believe that these are the signs of the professional execution of a project.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Understanding JavaScript and its potential impact on search performance is a core skillset of the modern SEO professional. If search engines can’t crawl a site or can’t parse and understand the content, nothing is going to get indexed and the site is not going to rank.</p>
<p>The most important questions for an SEO relating to JavaScript: Can search engines see the content and grasp the website experience? If not, what solutions can be leveraged to fix this?</p>
<h2 id="Fundamentals"><a href="#Fundamentals" class="headerlink" title="Fundamentals"></a>Fundamentals</h2><h3 id="What-is-JavaScript"><a href="#What-is-JavaScript" class="headerlink" title="What is JavaScript?"></a>What is JavaScript?</h3><p>When creating a modern web page, there are three major components:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>HTML –</strong><br>Hypertext Markup Language serves as the backbone, or organizer of content, on a site. It is the structure of the website (e.g. headings, paragraphs, list elements, etc.) and defining static content.</li>
<li><strong>CSS –</strong><br>Cascading Style Sheets are the design, glitz, glam, and style added to a website. It makes up the presentation layer of the page.</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript –</strong><br>JavaScript is the interactivity and a core component of the dynamic web.</li>

<p>JavaScript is either placed in the HTML document within &lt;script&gt; tags (i.e., it is embedded in the HTML) or linked/referenced. There are currently a plethora of JavaScript libraries and frameworks, including jQuery, AngularJS, ReactJS, EmberJS, etc.</p>
<h4 id="JavaScript-libraries-and-frameworks"><a href="#JavaScript-libraries-and-frameworks" class="headerlink" title="JavaScript libraries and frameworks:"></a>JavaScript libraries and frameworks:</h4><p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/Q73aYj2.png!web" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="What-is-AJAX"><a href="#What-is-AJAX" class="headerlink" title="What is AJAX?"></a>What is AJAX?</h3><p>AJAX, or Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, is a set of web development techniques combining JavaScript and XML that allows web applications to communicate with a server in the background without interfering with the current page. Asynchronous means that other functions or lines of code can run while the_async_script is running. XML used to be the primary language to pass data; however, the term AJAX is used for all types of data transfers (including JSON; I guess “AJAJ” doesn’t sound as clean as “AJAX” [pun intended]).</p>
<p>A common use of AJAX is to update the content or layout of a webpage without initiating a full page refresh. Normally, when a page loads, all the assets on the page must be requested and fetched from the server and then rendered on the page. However, with AJAX, only the assets that differ between pages need to be loaded, which improves the user experience as they do not have to refresh the entire page.</p>
<p>One can think of AJAX as mini server calls. A good example of AJAX in action is Google Maps. The page updates without a full page reload (i.e., mini server calls are being used to load content as the user navigates).</p>

<h3 id="What-is-the-Document-Object-Model-DOM"><a href="#What-is-the-Document-Object-Model-DOM" class="headerlink" title="What is the Document Object Model (DOM)?"></a>What is the Document Object Model (DOM)?</h3><p>As an SEO professional, you need to understand what the DOM is, because it’s what Google is using to analyze and understand webpages.</p>
<p>The DOM is what you see when you “Inspect Element” in a browser. Simply put, you can think of the DOM as the steps the browser takes after receiving the HTML document to render the page.</p>
<p>The first thing the browser receives is the HTML document. After that, it will start parsing the content within this document and fetch additional resources, such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files.</p>
<p>The DOM is what forms from this parsing of information and resources. One can think of it as a structured, organized version of the webpage’s code.</p>
<p>Nowadays the DOM is often very different from the initial HTML document, due to what’s collectively called<em>dynamic HTML</em>. Dynamic HTML is the ability for a page to change its content depending on user input, environmental conditions (e.g. time of day), and other variables, leveraging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
<p>Simple example with a &lt;title&gt; tag that is populated through JavaScript:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left">HTML source</th>
<th style="text-align:left">DOM</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/QBJ3qeM.png!web" alt=""></td>

<h3 id="What-is-headless-browsing"><a href="#What-is-headless-browsing" class="headerlink" title="What is headless browsing?"></a>What is headless browsing?</h3><p>Headless browsing is simply the action of fetching webpages without the user interface. It is important to understand because Google,<a href="https://www.merkleinc.com/blog/baidu-adds-new-spider-rendering-job" target="_blank" rel="external">and now Baidu</a>, leverage headless browsing to gain a better understanding of the user’s experience and the content of webpages.</p>
<p><a href="http://phantomjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">PhantomJS</a>and<a href="http://zombie.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Zombie.js</a>are scripted headless browsers, typically used for automating web interaction for testing purposes, and rendering static HTML snapshots for initial requests (pre-rendering).</p>

(and how to fix issues)"></a>Why can JavaScript be challenging for SEO? (and how to fix issues)</h2><p>There are three (3) primary reasons to be concerned about JavaScript on your site:</p>
<ol>
<li>Crawlability: Bots’ ability to crawl your site.</li>
<li>Obtainability: Bots’ ability to access information and parse your content.</li>
<li>Perceived site latency: AKA the Critical Rendering Path.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/bAVB7bI.png!web" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="Crawlability"><a href="#Crawlability" class="headerlink" title="Crawlability"></a>Crawlability</h3><p>Are bots able to find URLs and understand your site’s architecture? There are two important elements here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Blocking search engines from your JavaScript (even accidentally).</li>
<li>Proper internal linking, not leveraging JavaScript events as a replacement for HTML tags.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="Why-is-blocking-JavaScript-such-a-big-deal"><a href="#Why-is-blocking-JavaScript-such-a-big-deal" class="headerlink" title="Why is blocking JavaScript such a big deal?"></a>Why is blocking JavaScript such a big deal?</h4><p>If search engines are<a href="https://moz.com/blog/why-all-seos-should-unblock-js-css" target="_blank" rel="external">blocked from crawling JavaScript</a>, they will not be receiving your site’s full experience. This means search engines are not seeing what the end user is seeing. This can reduce your site’s appeal to search engines and could eventually be considered cloaking (if the intent is indeed malicious).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/googlebot-fetch" target="_blank" rel="external">Fetch as Google</a>and TechnicalSEO.com’s<a href="https://technicalseo.com/seo-tools/robots-txt/" target="_blank" rel="external">robots.txt</a>and<a href="https://technicalseo.com/seo-tools/fetch-render/" target="_blank" rel="external">Fetch and Render</a>testing tools can help to identify resources that Googlebot is blocked from.</p>
<p>The easiest way to solve this problem is through providing search engines access to the resources they need to understand your user experience.</p>
<p>_!!! Important note:_Work with your development team to determine which files should and should not be accessible to search engines.</p>
<h4 id="Internal-linking"><a href="#Internal-linking" class="headerlink" title="Internal linking"></a>Internal linking</h4><p>Internal linking should be implemented with regular anchor tags within the HTML or the DOM (using an<a href="https://moz.com/blog/www.example.com" target="_blank" rel="external">HTML tag) versus leveraging JavaScript functions to allow the user to traverse the site.</a></p>
<p>Essentially: Don’t use JavaScript’s onclick events as a replacement for internal linking. While end URLs might be found and crawled (through strings in JavaScript code or XML sitemaps), they won’t be associated with the global navigation of the site.</p>
<p>Internal linking is a strong signal to search engines regarding the site’s architecture and importance of pages. In fact, internal links are so strong that they can (in certain situations) override “SEO hints” such as canonical tags.</p>
<h4 id="URL-structure"><a href="#URL-structure" class="headerlink" title="URL structure"></a>URL structure</h4><p>Historically, JavaScript-based websites (aka “AJAX sites”) were using fragment identifiers (#) within URLs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Not recommended:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>The Lone Hash (#) –</strong><br>The lone pound symbol is not crawlable. It is used to identify anchor link (aka jump links). These are the links that allow one to jump to a piece of content on a page. Anything after the lone hash portion of the URL is never sent to the server and will cause the page to automatically scroll to the first element with a matching ID (or the first<br>&lt;<br>a<br>&gt;<br> element with a name of the following information).<br><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+JohnMueller/posts/LT4fU7kFB8W" target="_blank" rel="external">Google recommends</a><br>avoiding the use of “#“ in URLs.</li>
<li><strong>Hashbang (#!) (and</strong><br><a href="https://developers.google.com/webmasters/ajax-crawling/docs/specification" target="_blank" rel="external"><strong>escaped_fragments</strong></a><br><strong>URLs) –</strong><br>Hashbang URLs were a hack to support crawlers (Google wants to avoid now and only Bing supports). Many a moon ago, Google and Bing developed a complicated AJAX solution, whereby a pretty (#!) URL with the UX co-existed with an equivalent escaped_fragment HTML-based experience for bots. Google has since backtracked on this recommendation, preferring to receive the exact user experience. In escaped fragments, there are two experiences here:<ul>
<li><strong>Original Experience (aka Pretty URL):</strong><br>This URL must either have a #! (hashbang) within the URL to indicate that there is an escaped fragment or a meta element indicating that an escaped fragment exists (<br>&lt;<br>meta name=”fragment” content=”!”<br>&gt;<br>).</li>
<li><strong>Escaped Fragment (aka Ugly URL, HTML snapshot):</strong><br>This URL replace the hashbang (#!) with “_escaped_fragment_” and serves the HTML snapshot. It is called the ugly URL because it’s long and looks like (and for all intents and purposes is) a hack.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Recommended:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>pushState History API –</strong><br>PushState is navigation-based and part of the History API (think: your web browsing history). Essentially, pushState updates the URL in the address bar and only what needs to change on the page is updated. It allows JS sites to leverage “clean” URLs. PushState is currently<br><a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2016/11/building-indexable-progressive-web-apps.html" target="_blank" rel="external">supported by Google</a><br>, when supporting browser navigation for client-side or hybrid rendering.<ul>
<li>A good use of pushState is for infinite scroll (i.e., as the user hits new parts of the page the URL will update). Ideally, if the user refreshes the page, the experience will land them in the exact same spot. However, they do not need to refresh the page, as the content updates as they scroll down, while the URL is updated in the address bar.</li>
<li>Example: A good example of a search engine-friendly infinite scroll implementation, created by Google’s John Mueller (go figure), can be found<br><a href="http://scrollsample.appspot.com/items" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a><br>. He technically leverages the replaceState(), which doesn’t include the same back button functionality as pushState.</li>

<h3 id="Obtainability"><a href="#Obtainability" class="headerlink" title="Obtainability"></a>Obtainability</h3><p>Search engines have been shown to employ headless browsing to render the DOM to gain a better understanding of the user’s experience and the content on page. That is to say, Google can process some JavaScript and uses the DOM (instead of the HTML document).</p>
<p>At the same time, there are situations where search engines struggle to comprehend JavaScript. Nobody wants<a href="http://www.linkresearchtools.com/case-studies/hulu-javascript-fail-visibility-drop/" target="_blank" rel="external">a Hulu situation</a>to happen to their site or a client’s site. It is crucial to understand how bots are interacting with your onsite content. When you aren’t sure, test.</p>
<p>Assuming we’re talking about a search engine bot that executes JavaScript, there are a few important elements for search engines to be able to obtain content:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the user must interact for something to fire, search engines probably aren’t seeing it.<ul>
<li>Google is a lazy user. It doesn’t click, it doesn’t scroll, and it doesn’t log in. If the full UX demands action from the user, special precautions should be taken to ensure that bots are receiving an equivalent experience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the JavaScript occurs after the JavaScript load event fires plus ~5-seconds*, search engines may not be seeing it.<ul>
<li>*<br><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/js-sites-wg/ZFBMv2TcB3M" target="_blank" rel="external">John Mueller mentioned</a><br>that there is no specific timeout value; however, sites should aim to load within five seconds.</li>
<li>*<br><a href="https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/crawl-javascript-seo/" target="_blank" rel="external">Screaming Frog tests</a><br>show a correlation to five seconds to render content.</li>
<li>*The load event plus five seconds is what Google’s PageSpeed Insights, Mobile Friendliness Tool, and Fetch as Google use; check out<br><a href="https://maxxeight.com/tests/js-timer/" target="_blank" rel="external">Max Prin’s test timer</a><br>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If there are errors within the JavaScript, both browsers and search engines won’t be able to go through and potentially miss sections of pages if the entire code is not executed.</li>
</ul>

TEST"></a>1. TEST</h4><p>The most popular solution to resolving JavaScript is probably not resolving anything (grab a coffee and let Google work its algorithmic brilliance). Providing Google with the same experience as searchers is<a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2015/10/deprecating-our-ajax-crawling-scheme.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Google’s preferred scenario</a>.</p>
<p>Google first announced being able to “better understand the web (i.e., JavaScript)” in<a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/05/understanding-web-pages-better.html" target="_blank" rel="external">May 2014</a>. Industry experts suggested that Google could crawl JavaScript way before this announcement. The iPullRank team offered two great pieces on this in 2011:<a href="http://ipullrank.com/googlebot-is-chrome/" target="_blank" rel="external">Googlebot is Chrome</a>and<a href="https://moz.com/blog/just-how-smart-are-search-robots" target="_blank" rel="external">How smart are Googlebots?</a>(thank you, Josh and Mike). Adam Audette’s<a href="http://searchengineland.com/tested-googlebot-crawls-javascript-heres-learned-220157" target="_blank" rel="external">Google can crawl JavaScript and leverages the DOM</a>in 2015 confirmed. Therefore, if you can see your content in the DOM, chances are your content is being parsed by Google.</p>
<p><img src="http://img1.tuicool.com/ZJj6VrV.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>Recently, Barry Goralewicz performed<a href="https://goralewicz.com/blog/javascript-seo-experiment/" target="_blank" rel="external">a cool experiment testing a combination of various JavaScript libraries and frameworks</a>to determine how Google interacts with the pages (e.g., are they indexing URL/content? How does GSC interact? Etc.). It ultimately showed that Google is able to interact with many forms of JavaScript and highlighted certain frameworks as perhaps more challenging.<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/js-sites-wg" target="_blank" rel="external">John Mueller even started a JavaScript search group</a>(from what I’ve read, it’s fairly therapeutic).</p>
<p>All of these studies are amazing and help SEOs understand when to be concerned and take a proactive role. However, before you determine that sitting back is the right solution for your site, I recommend being actively cautious by experimenting with small section Think: Jim Collin’s “bullets, then cannonballs” philosophy from his book<a href="http://www.jimcollins.com/books/great-by-choice.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Great by Choice</a>:</p>
<p>“A bullet is an empirical test aimed at learning what works and meets three criteria: a bullet must be low-cost, low-risk, and low-distraction… 10Xers use bullets to empirically validate what will actually work. Based on that empirical validation, they then concentrate their resources to fire a cannonball, enabling large returns from concentrated bets.”</p>
<p>Consider testing and reviewing through the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Confirm that your content is appearing within the DOM.</li>
<li>Test a subset of pages to see if Google can index content.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Manually check quotes from your content.</li>
<li><p>Fetch with Google and see if content appears.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fetch with Google supposedly occurs around the load event or before timeout. It’s a great test to check to see if Google will be able to see your content and whether or not you’re blocking JavaScript in your robots.txt. Although Fetch with Google is not foolproof, it’s a good starting point.</p>
</li>
<li>Note: If you aren’t verified in GSC, try<br><a href="https://technicalseo.com/seo-tools/fetch-render/" target="_blank" rel="external">Technicalseo.com’s Fetch and Render As Any Bot Tool</a><br>.</li>
</ul>
<p>After you’ve tested all this, what if something’s not working and search engines and bots are struggling to index and obtain your content? Perhaps you’re concerned about alternative search engines (DuckDuckGo, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.), or maybe you’re leveraging meta information that needs to be parsed by other bots, such as Twitter summary cards or Facebook Open Graph tags. If any of this is identified in testing or presents itself as a concern, an HTML snapshot may be the only decision.</p>
<h4 id="2-HTML-SNAPSHOTS"><a href="#2-HTML-SNAPSHOTS" class="headerlink" title="2. HTML SNAPSHOTS"></a>2. HTML SNAPSHOTS</h4><h4 id="What-are-HTmL-snapshots"><a href="#What-are-HTmL-snapshots" class="headerlink" title="What are HTmL snapshots?"></a>What are HTmL snapshots?</h4><p>HTML snapshots are a fully rendered page (as one might see in the DOM) that can be returned to search engine bots (think: a static HTML version of the DOM).</p>
<p><a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2009/10/proposal-for-making-ajax-crawlable.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Google introduced HTML snapshots 2009</a>,<a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2015/10/deprecating-our-ajax-crawling-scheme.html" target="_blank" rel="external">deprecated (but still supported) them in 2015</a>, and awkwardly mentioned them as<a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2016/11/building-indexable-progressive-web-apps.html" target="_blank" rel="external">an element to “avoid”</a>in late 2016. HTML snapshots are a contentious topic with Google. However, they’re important to understand, because in certain situations they’re necessary.</p>
<p>If search engines (or sites like Facebook) cannot grasp your JavaScript, it’s better to return an HTML snapshot than not to have your content indexed and understood at all. Ideally, your site would leverage some form of user-agent detection on the server side and return the HTML snapshot to the bot.</p>
<p>At the same time, one must recognize that Google wants the same experience as the user (i.e., only provide Google with an HTML snapshot if the tests are dire and the<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/js-sites-wg" target="_blank" rel="external">JavaScript search group</a>cannot provide support for your situation).</p>
<h4 id="Considerations"><a href="#Considerations" class="headerlink" title="Considerations"></a>Considerations</h4><p>When considering HTML snapshots, you must consider that Google has deprecated this AJAX recommendation. Although Google technically still supports it, Google recommends avoiding it. Yes, Google changed its mind and now want to receive the same experience as the user. This direction makes sense, as it allows the bot to receive an experience more true to the user experience.</p>
<p>A second consideration factor relates to the risk of cloaking. If the HTML snapshots are found to not represent the experience on the page, it’s considered a cloaking risk. Straight from the source:</p>
<p>“The HTML snapshot must contain the same content as the end user would see in a browser. If this is not the case, it may be considered cloaking.”</p>
<p>–<a href="https://developers.google.com/webmasters/ajax-crawling/docs/faq#cloaking" target="_blank" rel="external">Google Developer AJAX Crawling FAQs</a></p>
<h4 id="Benefits"><a href="#Benefits" class="headerlink" title="Benefits"></a>Benefits</h4><p>Despite the considerations, HTML snapshots have powerful advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Knowledge that search engines and crawlers will be able to understand the experience.<ul>
<li>Certain types of JavaScript may be harder for Google to grasp (cough… Angular (also colloquially referred to as AngularJS 2) …cough).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other search engines and crawlers (think: Bing, Facebook) will be able to understand the experience.<ul>
<li>Bing, among other search engines, has not stated that it can crawl and index JavaScript. HTML snapshots may be the only solution for a JavaScript-heavy site. As always, test to make sure that this is the case before diving in.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="Site-latency"><a href="#Site-latency" class="headerlink" title="Site latency"></a>Site latency</h4><p>When browsers receive an HTML document and create the DOM (although there is some level of pre-scanning), most resources are loaded as they appear within the HTML document. This means that if you have a huge file toward the top of your HTML document, a browser will load that immense file first.</p>
<p>The concept of Google’s critical rendering path is to load what the user needs as soon as possible, which can be translated to → “get everything above-the-fold in front of the user, ASAP.”</p>
<h4 id="Critical-Rendering-Path-Optimized-Rendering-Loads-Progressively-ASAP"><a href="#Critical-Rendering-Path-Optimized-Rendering-Loads-Progressively-ASAP" class="headerlink" title="Critical Rendering Path - Optimized Rendering Loads Progressively ASAP:"></a>Critical Rendering Path - Optimized Rendering Loads Progressively ASAP:</h4><p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/zMjQFrF.png!web" alt=""></p>
<p>Image<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/" target="_blank" rel="external">source</a></p>
<p>However, if you have unnecessary resources or JavaScript files clogging up the page’s ability to load, you get “render-blocking JavaScript.” Meaning: your JavaScript is blocking the page’s potential to appear as if it’s loading faster (also called: perceived latency).</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/BVNRN3B.png!web" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="Render-blocking-JavaScript-–-Solutions"><a href="#Render-blocking-JavaScript-–-Solutions" class="headerlink" title="Render-blocking JavaScript – Solutions"></a>Render-blocking JavaScript – Solutions</h4><p>If you analyze your page speed results (through tools like<a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/" target="_blank" rel="external">Page Speed Insights Tool</a>,<a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">WebPageTest.org</a>, CatchPoint, etc.) and determine that there is a render-blocking JavaScript issue, here are three potential solutions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Inline: Add the JavaScript in the HTML document.</li>
<li><p>Async: Make JavaScript asynchronous (i.e., add “async” attribute to HTML tag).</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/Bba67bj.png!web" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li>Defer: By placing JavaScript lower within the HTML.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="http://img1.tuicool.com/FbU7n2N.png!web" alt=""></p>
<p>_!!! Important note:_It’s important to understand that scripts must be arranged in order of precedence. Scripts that are used to load the above-the-fold content must be prioritized and should not be deferred. Also, any script that references another file can only be used after the referenced file has loaded. Make sure to work closely with your development team to confirm that there are no interruptions to the user’s experience.</p>

<h2 id="TL-DR-Moral-of-the-story"><a href="#TL-DR-Moral-of-the-story" class="headerlink" title="TL;DR - Moral of the story"></a>TL;DR - Moral of the story</h2><p>Crawlers and search engines will do their best to crawl, execute, and interpret your JavaScript, but it is not guaranteed. Make sure your content is crawlable, obtainable, and isn’t developing site latency obstructions. The key = every situation demands testing. Based on the results, evaluate potential solutions.</p>

You can now send your emails when you want with a new Send Later feature, use delivery and read receipts to make sure your emails are received and even create calendar events and tasks from your emails.

<p>The Send Later function is hidden under the little down arrow by the Send Email button and will be available to Office Insider Fast members now and Office 365 subscribers in July. All other new features should be ready for Office 365 subscribers right away, including the easier onboarding process, which automatically detects your email settings from your address so you don’t have to, and read receipts, which may be the bane of our existence, but seem to make business users pretty happy.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Good design takes time and often years of experience and experimentation to getright.Itis built on certain conventions and rules that serve as the basis of a good design. A common example of a design convention is the use of contrasting colors to make text look better on a colored background.<strong>Vaunt</strong>is a free macOS that lets you find the dominant colors in an image. It’s a simple menu bar utility that you can drag &amp; drop imaged on to. It will find the dominant colors in an image and display all shades of it that appear in the image. You can click a color and its HEX code will automatically be copied to your clipboard.</p>
<p>Download and run Vaunt. It runs entirely from the menu bar. Click the menu bar icon to open the app and drag &amp; drop the image you want to analyze into the designated area. Give it a few seconds and it will show you a selection of colors that appear in the image.</p>
<p>Vaunt will show you multiple shades of the dominant color. It finds this color using a clustering algorithm and it accounts for the variation in shades by providing you different ones that it detects in the image. Click a color to copy its HEX code to your clipboard.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/mac-os/how-to-find-the-dominant-colors-in-an-image/attachment/vaunt/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://cloud.addictivetips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/vaunt.jpg" alt="" title="vaunt"></a></p>
<p>We tested the app out with a very psychedelic Alice in Wonderland wallpaper and the poster for Suicide Squad (2016). In both cases, there were two very distinct colors that were dominant in the image. We ran the images multiple times through Vaunt and it returned at least two different dominant colors for each image.</p>

<p>The color that Vaunt identifies as dominant depends on the area it analyzes. For images like posters or wallpapers, the results can vary greatly each time you run them through the app. This is because the app is looking at and analyzing a different part of the image. Vaunt can analyze both PNG and JPG images.</p>

<p>The Armani brand is already synonymous with high fashion, and now the company wants to add smartwatches to its lineup. Armani announced that its firstAndroid Wear 2.0 device, the Emporio Armani Connected, will go on sale in its stores starting on September 14. The company previously<a href="http://www.androidauthority.com/emporio-armani-connected-hybrid-watch-725061/" target="_blank" rel="external">released a hybrid smartwatch</a>that went on sale in the fall of 2016.</p>

<h4 id="Best-Android-Wear-watches"><a href="#Best-Android-Wear-watches" class="headerlink" title="Best Android Wear watches"></a>Best Android Wear watches</h4><p>2 weeks ago</p>
<p>The new touchscreen wearable will be one of the over 300 different hybrid and full smartwatches<a href="http://www.androidauthority.com/fossil-goes-full-android-wear-300-connected-watches-planned-year-759053/" target="_blank" rel="external">that will be made by Fossil</a>, which is also making and marketing devices for other fashion brands like Michael Kors, Skagen, Diesel, DKNY, and Marc Jacobs. In this case, the Emporio Armani Connected will be sold with support for up to eight different straps, along with a number of exclusive watchfaces. There’s not a lot of info on its hardware specs, but on the surface it looks it will be fairly typical Android Wear smartwatch, with a round display and a Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor inside.</p>
<p>However, you are paying for the brand name, not the hardware, when you decide to get the Emporio Armani Connected. Pricing has not yet been announced but we expect it to be on the higher side of Android Wear products.</p>
