    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A long time ago I bought an Ethernet ENC28J60 but I just recently tested it and, although I enjoy Java and I’ve used it in all of my previous projects to develop the interface between Arduino and server, it was clear to me that Python would be a much better choice in this case.</p>
<p>In 2014, I decided to use<a href="https://panamahitek.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Panama Hitek Arduino SDK</a>and then I sent them an email sharing my experience with their new SDK version. In 2016, I randomly met the guys from the Panama Hitek at the Fedora Latin America Meeting in IRC. Sharing your experience as a developer and be engaging in communities is very important, maybe you will meet the developers of your favorite framework in these spaces or even work with them. For me, it’s one more example of the importance of sharing knowledge and ideas through articles, talks, meetings etc. So, don’t be shy or scared of sharing what you know.</p>
<h2 id="IoT-is-about-being-connected"><a href="#IoT-is-about-being-connected" class="headerlink" title="IoT is about being connected"></a>IoT is about being connected</h2><p>IoT, embedded systems and smart devices are different concepts and there’s a constant confusion when using these terms.</p>
<p>If your device is disconnected from Internet, it probably isn’t generating the value of an IoT device. Being connected is more than reading commands remotely from an app, it’s a possibility to interact in different ways with your client and other systems like Twitter and also to collect useful information that can be used to make it even smarter.</p>
<h2 id="First-step"><a href="#First-step" class="headerlink" title="First step"></a>First step</h2><p>Register your app in Twitter to consume their API. Access<a href="https://apps.twitter.com/app/new" target="_blank" rel="external">Twitter Dev</a>to create your Twitter application and generate an access token to enable tweeting from your account (“Keys and Access Tokens” &gt; “Create my access token”)</p>
<h2 id="Solutions"><a href="#Solutions" class="headerlink" title="Solutions"></a>Solutions</h2><h3 id="The-Chuck-Norris-way"><a href="#The-Chuck-Norris-way" class="headerlink" title="The Chuck Norris way"></a>The Chuck Norris way</h3><p>You can develop your own C program to connect with Arduino and send HTTPS requests to the Twitter API. There’s a<a href="https://arduino-tweet.appspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Tweet Library for Arduino</a>available but it’s deprecated and needs refactoring to work with Arduino versions higher than 1.6.4.</p>
<p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/Fb6ZZrq.gif" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="The-easy-way"><a href="#The-easy-way" class="headerlink" title="The easy way"></a>The easy way</h3><p>Working with pointers and in a low level can be complicated if you don’t have experience with C and micro-controller, registers, digital systems etc. Use a python script and it will be much easier to code and maintain the software. Python will be responsible for exposing a web server which will then be consumed by your Arduino and send the content (e.g, sensor values, commands to turn on or off the lights etc) to Twitter. Note that Arduino UNO has limitations when building HTTP requests (it was necessary to use GET method instead of POST to create a tweet) and for this reason Python<strong>doesn’t expose an API</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Requirements"><a href="#Requirements" class="headerlink" title="Requirements"></a>Requirements</h2><ul>
<li>UIPEthernet</li>
<li>Python 2.7</li>
<li>pip</li>
<li>twython</li>
<li>flask</li>
</ul>
<p>EtherShield and ETHER_28J60 are common libraries used in most of tutorials, but UIPEthernet is compatible with the original Ethernet which allows you to use the examples avaiable in the Arduino IDE (File &gt; Examples &gt; Ethernet) just by replacing:</p>

<li>Creating a Suggestion Dropdown</li>
</ul>
<p>As far as dropdowns go, the most popular one on the Internet is Google’s AutoSuggest.</p>
<p>As you start to type, Google tries to guess what the user is looking for and provides a dropdown with suggestions so the user doesn’t have to type everything.</p>
<p>In the last post of this [link]series, we’ll discuss how to create a autosuggest dropdown control for your own UI.</p>
<h2 id="Overview"><a href="#Overview" class="headerlink" title="Overview"></a>Overview</h2><p>Throughout this series, you already know by now that we need to write JavaScript for our control.</p>
<p>For our autosuggest dropdown, we’ll use a standard Text Box along with a custom DIV that displays below it.</p>
<p>As the user types in the text box, we’ll take their input and send it back to the server using a Web API.</p>
<p>This is probably the only post in the series without a ViewModel since everything is done through JavaScript.</p>
<h2 id="Our-WebAPI"><a href="#Our-WebAPI" class="headerlink" title="Our WebAPI"></a>Our WebAPI</h2><p>For our autosuggest to work, we need a Web API similar to our<a href="https://www.danylkoweb.com/Blog/cascading-dropdowns-in-aspnet-mvc-JY" target="_blank" rel="external">Cascading Dropdown WebAPI</a>.</p>
<p>It’s similar, but instead we want distinct make and models of cars and we only want 10 of them displayed in the dropdown.</p>

<p>When the user presses a key, we check to see the following codes:</p>
<ul>
<li>ESC (27) - Close the dropdown when it’s visible.</li>
<li>Down Arrow (40) - Move to the next option in the dropdown.</li>
<li>Up Arrow (38) - Move to the previous option in the dropdown.</li>
<li>Enter (13) - Select the highlighted item in the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, when none of our keys are caught, we assume the user is entering their search criteria.</p>
<p>We show the “dropdown” by removing the hidden CSS class and make our call to the Web API.</p>
<p>Once retrieved, we add the items to our list and attach click events to our anchors in the list.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In this final post to our dropdown series, I wanted to show how easy it is to create an autosuggest dropdown. Not only did we make our dropdown list clickable, we also added keyboard events for those keyboard-jockeys who avoid the mouse.</p>
<p>This dropdown series explained thebasics of dropdowns, how to use<a href="https://www.danylkoweb.com/Blog/using-dropdowns-in-grids-JX" target="_blank" rel="external">dropdowns inside and outside of webgrids</a>, mutiple ways to<a href="https://www.danylkoweb.com/Blog/cascading-dropdowns-in-aspnet-mvc-JY" target="_blank" rel="external">implement cascading dropdowns</a>, and, of course, how to create an autosuggest dropdown.</p>
<p>I hope this series has shown a detailed and easy way to implement dropdowns in ASP.NET MVC.</p>
<p>Was this autosuggest easy to implement? Is there a better way to do this? Post your comments below and let’s discuss.</p>

    <title>Duel: gdb vs. linked lists, trees, and hash tables</title>

    <published>2017-06-19T00:00:00.000Z</published>
    <updated>2017-06-19T10:00:48.340Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My first encounter with the gdb command<code>duel</code>was on some old IRIX about 15 years ago. I immediately loved how convenient it was for displaying various data structures during MySQL debugging, and I wished Linux had something similar. Later I found out that Duel was not something IRIX specific, but a public domain patch for gdb 4.6 written in ’93 by Michael Golan. Unfortunately, it never got into gdb (for licensing reasons, so I’ve heard). Now the gdb 8 is out, and the patch, obviously doesn’t apply. Instead of fixing the patch, I’ve re-implemented Duel in Python, using<a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Python-API.html" target="_blank" rel="external">gdb Python API</a>and the<a href="https://github.com/igordejanovic/Arpeggio" target="_blank" rel="external">Arpeggio</a>parser. Now it can be loaded run-time into your gdb, no patching or compilation is needed. And, hopefully, it will work over many gdb versions, as it no longer relies on undocumented gdb internals. So, allow me to introduce…<strong>Duel.py</strong>for gdb!</p>
<h2 id="Examples"><a href="#Examples" class="headerlink" title="Examples"></a>Examples</h2><p>Let’s start with a few examples, to get the taste of it. Michael Golan managed to create a concise but very naturally-looking language. For example, while<code>a-&gt;b</code>means the element<code>b</code>of the structure pointer<code>a</code>, in Duel<code>a--&gt;b</code>means to walk the linked list, producing the sequence of values<code>a</code>,<code>a-&gt;b</code>,<code>a-&gt;b-&gt;b</code>, and so on. In MariaDB, all tables of a query are stored in a linked list, and it can be printed with just one command:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div><div class="line">7</div><div class="line">8</div><div class="line">9</div><div class="line">10</div><div class="line">11</div><div class="line">12</div><div class="line">13</div><div class="line">14</div><div class="line">15</div><div class="line">16</div><div class="line">17</div><div class="line">18</div><div class="line">19</div><div class="line">20</div><div class="line">21</div><div class="line">22</div><div class="line">23</div><div class="line">24</div><div class="line">25</div><div class="line">26</div><div class="line">27</div><div class="line">28</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">(gdb) dl table_list--</div><div class="line">&gt;</div><div class="line">next_local-</div><div class="line">&gt;</div><div class="line">table_name</div><div class="line">tables-</div><div class="line">&gt;</div><div class="line">table_name = </div><div class="line">0x7fffc40126b8</div><div class="line">&quot;t2&quot;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">tables-</div><div class="line">&gt;</div><div class="line">next_local-</div><div class="line">&gt;</div><div class="line">table_name = </div><div class="line">0x7fffc4012d18</div><div class="line">&quot;t1&quot;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">tables--</div><div class="line">&gt;</div><div class="line">next_local[[</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">]]-</div><div class="line">&gt;</div><div class="line">table_name = </div><div class="line">0x7fffc4013388</div><div class="line">&quot;t1&quot;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Also, quite naturally, instead of a number, you can specify a range, great for printing arrays:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div><div class="line">7</div><div class="line">8</div><div class="line">9</div><div class="line">10</div><div class="line">11</div><div class="line">12</div><div class="line">13</div><div class="line">14</div><div class="line">15</div><div class="line">16</div><div class="line">17</div><div class="line">18</div><div class="line">19</div><div class="line">20</div><div class="line">21</div><div class="line">22</div><div class="line">23</div><div class="line">24</div><div class="line">25</div><div class="line">26</div><div class="line">27</div><div class="line">28</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">(gdb) dl longopts[</div><div class="line">0.</div><div class="line">.405</div><div class="line">].name</div><div class="line">longopts[</div><div class="line">0</div><div class="line">].name = </div><div class="line">&quot;help&quot;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">longopts[</div><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">].name = </div><div class="line">&quot;allow-suspicious-udfs&quot;</div><div class="line">&lt;</div><div class="line">...</div><div class="line"> cut </div><div class="line">...</div><div class="line">&gt;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">longopts[</div><div class="line">404</div><div class="line">].name = </div><div class="line">&quot;session_track_transaction_info&quot;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">longopts[</div><div class="line">405</div><div class="line">].name = </div><div class="line">&quot;session_track_state_change&quot;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>And instead of any expression, you can specify a set of expressions:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div><div class="line">7</div><div class="line">8</div><div class="line">9</div><div class="line">10</div><div class="line">11</div><div class="line">12</div><div class="line">13</div><div class="line">14</div><div class="line">15</div><div class="line">16</div><div class="line">17</div><div class="line">18</div><div class="line">19</div><div class="line">20</div><div class="line">21</div><div class="line">22</div><div class="line">23</div><div class="line">24</div><div class="line">25</div><div class="line">26</div><div class="line">27</div><div class="line">28</div><div class="line">29</div><div class="line">30</div><div class="line">31</div><div class="line">32</div><div class="line">33</div><div class="line">34</div><div class="line">35</div><div class="line">36</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">(gdb) </div><div class="line">dl</div><div class="line"> my_long_options[</div><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">..</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">].(name,def_value)</div><div class="line">my_long_options[</div><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">].(name) = </div><div class="line">&quot;allow-suspicious-udfs&quot;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">my_long_options[</div><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">].(def_value) = </div><div class="line">0</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">my_long_options[</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">].(name) = </div><div class="line">&quot;ansi&quot;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">my_long_options[</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">].(def_value) = </div><div class="line">0</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">my_long_options[</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">].(name) = </div><div class="line">&quot;autocommit&quot;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">my_long_options[</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">].(def_value) = </div><div class="line">1</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<h2 id="Concepts"><a href="#Concepts" class="headerlink" title="Concepts"></a>Concepts</h2><p>Duel is built on the idea that every expression can return multiple values. You’ve seen<code>a..b</code>,<code>a--&gt;b</code>, and<code>a,b</code>as examples of such expressions. Any such expression can be used normally with other operators. Like in</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div><div class="line">7</div><div class="line">8</div><div class="line">9</div><div class="line">10</div><div class="line">11</div><div class="line">12</div><div class="line">13</div><div class="line">14</div><div class="line">15</div><div class="line">16</div><div class="line">17</div><div class="line">18</div><div class="line">19</div><div class="line">20</div><div class="line">21</div><div class="line">22</div><div class="line">23</div><div class="line">24</div><div class="line">25</div><div class="line">26</div><div class="line">27</div><div class="line">28</div><div class="line">29</div><div class="line">30</div><div class="line">31</div><div class="line">32</div><div class="line">33</div><div class="line">34</div><div class="line">35</div><div class="line">36</div><div class="line">37</div><div class="line">38</div><div class="line">39</div><div class="line">40</div><div class="line">41</div><div class="line">42</div><div class="line">43</div><div class="line">44</div><div class="line">45</div><div class="line">46</div><div class="line">47</div><div class="line">48</div><div class="line">49</div><div class="line">50</div><div class="line">51</div><div class="line">52</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">(</div><div class="line">gdb</div><div class="line">) dl (</div><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">..</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">)+(</div><div class="line">100</div><div class="line">,</div><div class="line">200</div><div class="line">)</div><div class="line">(</div><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">) + (</div><div class="line">100</div><div class="line">) = </div><div class="line">101</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">(</div><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">) + (</div><div class="line">200</div><div class="line">) = </div><div class="line">201</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">(</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">) + (</div><div class="line">100</div><div class="line">) = </div><div class="line">102</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">(</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">) + (</div><div class="line">200</div><div class="line">) = </div><div class="line">202</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">(</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">) + (</div><div class="line">100</div><div class="line">) = </div><div class="line">103</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">(</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">) + (</div><div class="line">200</div><div class="line">) = </div><div class="line">203</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Besides operators that generate multiple values, there are operators that stop generation and grep-like operators that filter generated values. Let’s take a closer look.</p>
<h2 id="Operators"><a href="#Operators" class="headerlink" title="Operators"></a>Operators</h2><p>Duel syntax is C-like, C operators work as expected, one can use C-style casts, refer to variables and invoke functions of the inferior (program, being debugged). But additionally one can use special Duel operators that deal with multiple values.</p>
<h4 id="Ranges-and-lists-and"><a href="#Ranges-and-lists-and" class="headerlink" title="Ranges and lists,..and,"></a>Ranges and lists,<code>..</code>and<code>,</code></h4><p>You’ve seen examples above. These operators look rather familiar, they exist in other languages too. A range can have both or only one end specified,<code>..x</code>means a range of<code>x</code>elements, same as<code>0..x-1</code>. An open range<code>x..</code>will generate values ad infinitum (or until the counter overflows, whatever comes first), one usually uses it with the<code>@</code>“until” operator.</p>
<h4 id="Until"><a href="#Until" class="headerlink" title="Until,@"></a>Until,<code>@</code></h4><p>In the<code>x@y</code>expression,<code>x</code>will keep generating values until<code>y</code>becomes true. For example,</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div><div class="line">7</div><div class="line">8</div><div class="line">9</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">(gdb) </div><div class="line">dl</div><div class="line"> arr[</div><div class="line">0</div><div class="line">..]@(</div><div class="line">count</div><div class="line">&gt;</div><div class="line">10</div><div class="line">)</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>will print elements of the<code>arr</code>array, until<code>arr[i].count</code>becomes larger than ten. As a convenient shortcut, the second argument can be a constant, in this case the generation stops as soon as the generated value becomes equal to this constant.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="5-Former-Design-Trends-That-Aren’t-Cool-Anymore-So-Stop-Using-Them"><a href="#5-Former-Design-Trends-That-Aren’t-Cool-Anymore-So-Stop-Using-Them" class="headerlink" title="5 Former Design Trends That Aren’t Cool Anymore (So Stop Using Them)"></a>5 Former Design Trends That Aren’t Cool Anymore (So Stop Using Them)</h2><p>If you’re like me, looking at your own design work from a few years ago can often result in some laughable or even cringe-worthy moments. Design styles have been steadily evolving and most of us can’t help but be affected by these changes. Who among us hasn’t piled on the cheesy Photoshop layer effects, all the while thinking the result was downright awesome?</p>
<p>However, some of us are a little slower to evolve than others. Today we’ll be taking a walk down memory lane and looking at five design trends that used to be super cool, but now simply tend to make your design look outdated and even ugly. If you’re currently still stuck on these trends, it might be time to move along! We’ll help you out with some modern alternative practices that you can use to bring your design skills into the current year in a hurry.</p>
<h2 id="Let’s-Make-Fun-of-Design"><a href="#Let’s-Make-Fun-of-Design" class="headerlink" title="Let’s Make Fun of Design"></a>Let’s Make Fun of Design</h2><p>We designers tend to take ourselves far too seriously. A post like this could easily lead to derogatory finger pointing and superiority complexes, but let’s go ahead and admit up front that we’ve all flirted with at least a few of these trends, many of us have jumped on board every single one of them.</p>
<p>The only way to escape this fact is to be a new designer, then all you’re doing is jumping on the trends of today. Don’t worry, you won’t regret or perhaps even acknowledge these decisions for at least another three to five years.</p>
<h3 id="What-Are-Design-Trends-Good-For"><a href="#What-Are-Design-Trends-Good-For" class="headerlink" title="What Are Design Trends Good For?"></a>What Are Design Trends Good For?</h3><p>The key to analyzing design trends is to remember that they aren’t inherently good or bad. Instead, they merely serve as a way to observe and remember the collective tastes of bygone eras.</p>
<p>By examining which design practices seem out of style and dated, you can avoid being that guy who still wears tie dye t-shirts on a first date.</p>
<p>In this way, they’re a fantastic history lesson on how styles have evolved over the years. Try to think of past design trends like fashion, something that was cool when you are young will eventually become deplorable, but don’t worry, by the time you’re old it’ll probably see a resurgence.</p>
<p>The practical lesson here is that by examining which design practices seem out of style and dated, you can avoid being that guy who still wears tie dye t-shirts on a first date. Is it the case that you should absolutely abandon all of the practices on this list forever? Absolutely not. Just like with that tie dye shirt, you can probably find a time or two where these seem appropriate, even if only ironically. And who knows? They could come back and become cool again before long!</p>
<h2 id="Bevel-and-Emboss"><a href="#Bevel-and-Emboss" class="headerlink" title="Bevel and Emboss"></a>Bevel and Emboss</h2><p>I know it’s tempting. You open up that Photoshop Effects window and_Bevel and Emboss_is like a siren calling from the rocks, pleading with you to add a touch of realism to your design. Before you know it, you’re staring at something like this:</p>

<p>There’s almost nothing that screams late 90s/early 2000s design like a good old bevel treatment. We went crazy with these things and put them on everything we touched. Even beloved, age old brand logos weren’t safe from the far reaching effects of this trend.</p>
<p>Like that picture of you on Facebook with the skinny jeans, we now look back on this trend with a “what was I thinking?” attitude. Don’t knockout it though, you’ll do the exact same thing in ten years to whatever you’re working on today!</p>
<h3 id="Do-This-Instead"><a href="#Do-This-Instead" class="headerlink" title="Do This Instead"></a>Do This Instead</h3><p>These days the trend across the board is much more minimalistic that it was ten years ago. We’ve gone past faux realistic bevels and, for the most part, dropped them completely. Now objects tend to have simple, uniform edges with almost no effects apart from the occasional subtle shadow.<a href="http://adrians.info/" target="_blank" rel="external">The World of Adrian Le Bas</a>is a prime example:</p>
<p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/aMnEvmA.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="Web-2-0-Gloss"><a href="#Web-2-0-Gloss" class="headerlink" title="Web 2.0 Gloss"></a>Web 2.0 Gloss</h2><p>The bevel and emboss trend wasn’t suddenly abandoned one day in favor of minimalism. Instead, it had to evolve into something even more ornate before we decided to run in the completely opposite direction.</p>
<p>Bevels alone tend to give an almost clay-like look to an object. Add in some shine though and you’ve suddenly got some fancy plastic and glass effects:</p>
<p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/7vQB32Q.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>This one still hasn’t effectively been killed off, you need not travel far to find its influences. I’ll even gloss up a button or two myself from time to time, though certainly not to this extreme. The problem is of course that stylistically, designers have largely dropped this and are moving once again towards more subtle choices. Implementing a heavily glossed web 2.0 style on your site is a surefire way to make a brand new site seem like it’s already due for a design refresh.</p>
<h3 id="Do-This-Instead-1"><a href="#Do-This-Instead-1" class="headerlink" title="Do This Instead"></a>Do This Instead</h3><p>The good news is that “attractive” buttons are even easier to make these days. All you need is a little border-radius and a slight drop-shadow or gradient. The effect is a nice button style that stands out without being too flashy. Check out this example from<a href="http://www.shopify.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Shopify</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/eYfumqq.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>It’s interesting to note how technology affects design trends. The Photoshop-centric effects of yesterday are giving way to CSS3 styles of today. You can expect this to continue as new possibilities come to light with pure code-driven design.</p>
<h2 id="Lots-of-Cursive-Text"><a href="#Lots-of-Cursive-Text" class="headerlink" title="Lots of Cursive Text"></a>Lots of Cursive Text</h2><p><img src="http://img1.tuicool.com/JRVZR3a.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>This one is a possible exception to my earlier statement about design trends being neither good nor bad from a purely objective standpoint. If a trend actually stands in the way of the success of a design, then it’s easy to argue that it is in fact an example of “bad” design.</p>
<p>I find this to be the case with big blocks of cursive text. For some reason, this is a trend that simply refuses to die. Following this trend is a double whammy of ugly design. Not only does it make your site uncomfortable to browse and read through, it also tends to reflect many of the typeface woes of the 1990s. If there’s one thing you_don’t_currently want someone to say about your site, it’s that it looks like something from when developers with no real design experience were first beginning to apply basic styles to websites.</p>
<h3 id="Do-This-Instead-2"><a href="#Do-This-Instead-2" class="headerlink" title="Do This Instead"></a>Do This Instead</h3><p>Instead of hitting your visitors over the head with overuse of that fancy typeface that you found free online, try instead sprinkling it in extremely selectively. Elementary school taught you that cursive is for professional communication; they lied. In design it should be used very selectively as an occasional accent to more readable alternatives.</p>
<p>There are dozens of<a href="https://designshack.net/articles/inspiration/100-beautiful-script-brush-calligraphy-fonts/" target="_blank" rel="external">beautiful script and calligraphy fonts</a>that have popped up in recent years from independent artists. The key is to choose one that’s readable, and don’t over-use it!</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/B7bemyB.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="The-Burst"><a href="#The-Burst" class="headerlink" title="The Burst"></a>The Burst</h2><p>This one has roots dating back to the early days of even print design. The burst is a tried and true way to grab your viewer’s attention. It says “hey, here’s some important information!” in a easy to implement and instantly recognizable way. The problem: it’s ugly and makes your design look like a marketing professor threw up on it.</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/Ibi22yj.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>My main problem with this is that it reflects a complete lack of thought and imagination. Instead of considering how to effectively integrate a logical and appropriate break into the design pattern, the designers who use this simply use the very first idea that pops into their heads. It would also be the very first idea of every non-designer as well, making it the most uncreative design element you could possibly use.</p>
<h3 id="Do-This-Instead-3"><a href="#Do-This-Instead-3" class="headerlink" title="Do This Instead"></a>Do This Instead</h3><p>The simple solution here is to put a_tiny bit_more thought into creating an element that fits with your overall design theme but still violates the page enough to grab attention. While there’s nothing worse than an invasive pop-over to promote a sale or discount, putting some thought into a stylish and well-designed solution can work well.<a href="https://www.pixelunion.net/apps/pixelpop/" target="_blank" rel="external">PixelPop</a>is a tool that does this perfectly, with thoughtful design and simple templates.</p>
<p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/NbMRvaQ.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="Retro-Redemption"><a href="#Retro-Redemption" class="headerlink" title="Retro Redemption"></a>Retro Redemption</h3><p>The real key to mastering design trends is to know what they suggest. Don’t implement a certain style just because you feel good about it today, instead analyze what it is that you want to achieve and what will work for and/or against that idea.</p>
<p>For instance, if you’re trying to create a modern e-commerce site that reflects current style choices in web design, you should avoid bursts like they’re an 80s rock-a-mullet. However, if you’re_intentionally_creating a retro look, then suddenly bursts once again become a perfectly legitimate and even attractive choice. Check out the<a href="http://www.tomanddan.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Tom and Dan Show site</a>below to see this idea in action:</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/ayMFzim.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="Dramatic-Drop-Shadows"><a href="#Dramatic-Drop-Shadows" class="headerlink" title="Dramatic Drop Shadows"></a>Dramatic Drop Shadows</h2><p>The story here is the same as that of the bevel. That Photoshop “Drop Shadow” layer style is just begging to be played with. If you start by tweaking the default effect, you’re likely to come up with something like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/ZbYrMf7.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>This shadow is big, soft, has plenty of distance and has a color that contrasts heavily with the background. Unfortunately, the result is a design that instantly reeks of cheesy fake lighting effects.</p>
<h3 id="Do-This-Instead-4"><a href="#Do-This-Instead-4" class="headerlink" title="Do This Instead"></a>Do This Instead</h3><p>There are still a million different popular ways to use drop shadows, the above example simply isn’t one of them. If you like the soft, feathered edge look, try blending the shadow in with the background so that it serves to make the text a tad more realistic without being a major distraction.</p>
<p><img src="http://img1.tuicool.com/aQFrimz.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>Another shadow treatment that’s popular right now harkens back to the days before it was common to use soft shadows. This effect uses a non-feathered drop shadow that has a little bit more of a retro feel.</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/raQNVzU.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>You can take this a step further by layering the shadow with a knock section in between the shadow and the text. Once again, this is leaning towards a refined aged feel.</p>
<p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/zqiMJjA.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The examples above should serve to illustrate the idea that following antiquated trends can in fact have a negative effect on your designs and the impressions they leave on your viewers. Once again, the main principal I’m trying to communicate is<em>intentionality</em>. As long as you know what it is your design style of choice is communicating, and that concept or time period is exactly what you’re going for, then you’re on the right track.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that design trends wouldn’t evolve at all without pioneers that go against what’s currently popular and blaze their own trail. Don’t be too eager to jump onto the overused tricks bandwagon if you’re working on a project that merits some innovative thought. Go your own way and let everyone follow you!</p>

<h3 id="About-“wants”-“cans”-“needs”-and-“shoulds”"><a href="#About-“wants”-“cans”-“needs”-and-“shoulds”" class="headerlink" title="About “wants”, “cans”, “needs”, and “shoulds”"></a>About “wants”, “cans”, “needs”, and “shoulds”</h3><p>The original<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/search?q=volume&amp;restrict_sr=on" target="_blank" rel="external">reddit post</a>has now hundreds of examples of terrible volume UI, and it keeps growing — a fun exercise/joke, that can strengthen one’s creative muscles and ability to think outside of the box. People have been participating simply for the fun of coming up with the most absurd and weird interactions and interface elements.</p>
<p>But there’s definitely a reflection point about the state our industry here.</p>
<p>I’m sure a lot of people reading this has, at some point in their careers,<strong>felt that urge of innovating no matter what</strong>. An uncontrollable desire of redesigning something that hasn’t been redesigned for too long. It_has_to be recreated. And it_has_to be innovative. Right?</p>
<p>That’s where the wants, cans, needs, and shoulds story comes in.</p>
<ul>
<li>Everybody<br><strong>wants</strong><br>to innovate. The design industry keeps nudging us to be creative, innovative, and to deliver design solutions that have never been thought of before. Pressure is on us. We are bombarded with messages telling us that, in order to be considered a solid designer, we<br><em>have</em><br>to innovate at any cost.</li>
<li>A lot of people<br><strong>can</strong><br>innovate. I definitely<br><em>can</em><br>redesign the volume control UI. All it takes is a bit of creativity and moderate design skills. Prototyping tools are becoming increasingly accessible, as well as other technologies that allow to bring to fruition whatever idea comes to mind. A few hours in front of Principle or Framer lets you create an extremely refined prototype of the interaction you are envisioning. You can also decide to create an app/site/chatbot to solve that same issue. You<br><em>can</em><br>.</li>
<li>No one<br><strong>needs</strong><br>to. Let’s be honest: the volume control design pattern has been around for decades, works pretty well for the majority of users, and is incredibly familiar to a lot of people. You don’t<br><em>need</em><br>to reinvent it.</li>
</ul>
<p>But then there’s the<strong>should</strong>.</p>
<p>ShouldI redesign the volume control UI?</p>
<p>Shouldis interesting because of its subjectiveness. It’s a question that only makes sense to be asked in first person. And you_have_to know about much more than just design to be able to answer it — you have to understand about business, technology, culture, people. Answering the<strong>should</strong>question is a skill you only get after many, many years answering questions alike.</p>
<p>We can try to quantify or measure the should, which makes sense some of the time. But part of it is, and will ever be, intuition. How is yours?</p>

    <title>How To Get Bed Time Alerts Based On When You Need To Wake Up</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple added a new feature in the<a href="https://www.addictivetips.com/ios/how-to-set-up-the-bedtime-alarm-in-ios-10/" target="_blank" rel="external">iOS clock app called Bed Time</a>. The feature helps you get 7-8 hours of sleep everyday. It asks you what time it is you have to wake up the next day, and then tells you when to go to bed. It’s useful considering most people use their phones as an alarm. The only thing is, if you’re awake and working, the device you’re looking at is going to be a desktop, not your phone.<strong>Sandman</strong>is a desktop app available for Windows, Mac, and Linux that does something similar to the iOS clock app. It gives you bed time alerts that ensure you get 7-8 hours of sleep.</p>
<p>Sandman looks at two things when it gives you bed time alerts; your working hours, and when you need to wake up. The app was designed with developers in mind who are prone to working long hours and missing essential sleep. The app learns what times a user works and tells them when enough is enough and they should go to bed.</p>
<p>Open Sandman. When you start out, it doesn’t know what your work schedule is. All you can do is tell the app when you need to wake up. It will work with that until it knows you schedule better.</p>

<p>When it’s time for bed, Sandman will give you an alert. You can dismiss it if you don’t like sleep, or you can use the Shutdown button on the alert to turn your system off and hit the hay.</p>

<p>Sandman is pretty smart. It takes into account how long you need to fall asleep. Some people fall asleep almost immediately. Other people stay awake for a few hours contemplating the meaning of life. Sandman’s bed time alerts can factor that time in. To configure how long it takes to for you to fall asleep, go to Sandman’s preferences via the Ctrl+P  shortcut.</p>
<p>Set how long it takes you to fall asleep. Sandman can also alert you when you’ve been working for twelve hours straight though you can customize this time slot to make it shorter or longer. Additionally, you can switch from the 12 hour format to the 24 hour format if you like.</p>

<p>If you lose track of time when you’re working then consider using Sandman. Work is important but doing it in a sleep deprived state is hardly good for you.</p>
<p>You can dismiss an alert from Sandman if you’re not ready to go to bed, but don’t make a habit of it. Try and get the required sleep you need everyday.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When a system goes to sleep, it preserves the state it was in. If you had apps and files open on your desktop, they will still be there when you get back. Everything from your work setup to your system configurations is stored. When you wake your system, you can pick up work where you left it off. macOS is no different. When it wakes from sleep, everything is exactly where you left it which is a good thing except in the case of your system’s volume. The volume is one thing that you might want to reset when you wake your system. If you left the volume high because you were playing music, it might startle you when you wake your system from sleep. Here’s how you can change the system volume on wake on macOS.</p>
<p>To change the system volume on wake, you need an app called<strong>AutoVolume</strong>. It’s a free open source macOS app that well reset the system volume when you wake your Mac from sleep.</p>
<p>Download and run AutoVolume. The app has a very basic interface. You set the volume you want your Mac to reset to when it wakes from sleep and enable it. Once you’ve set the volume, enable the app and close it. Be careful you don’t click the ‘Quit’ button. Quitting the app is different from closing it. If you quit the app, it will not change the system volume on Wake.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/mac-os/change-the-system-volume-on-wake-macos/attachment/autovolume/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://cloud.addictivetips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AutoVolume.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>After you set the volume level, you can forget about the app. You won’t see any indication of the app running. It doesn’t so much as have a Menu bar icon. When you’re done, either put your Mac to sleep or let it enter sleep automatically.</p>

<p>When you wake your Mac to use it the next time around, the volume will have changed to the one you set in AutoVolume.</p>
<p>Although you can set AutoVolume to run at start up, it doesn’t change the system volume when you boot your Mac. This app in its current state is meant to work only when you wake your Mac. If you normally let your Mac go to sleep instead of shutting it down at the end of each day, AutoVolume will ensure you or your co-workers aren’t blasted with loud audio notifications or music.</p>
<p>The app is still under development and it has an interesting list of requested features so, even if it isn’t feature rich at the moment, it’s an app you want to keep your eye on.</p>

A football star like Tom Brady, even at 39, is great because of who he is and his<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/feb/05/new-england-patriots-super-bowl-51-champions-atlanta-falcons" target="_blank" rel="external">accomplishments</a>.</p>
<p>When a company stands out, you know because there are certain traits and attributes you can identify, sometimes just by paying closer attention. They are widespread and hard to ignore, You can look for these signs by listening closely to what people say in a meeting or when they banter in the cafeteria or after work.</p>
<p>Here are the signs, in order of importance leading up to the most critical attribute:</p>
<h2 id="1-Everyone-is-having-fun"><a href="#1-Everyone-is-having-fun" class="headerlink" title="1. Everyone is having fun"></a>1. Everyone is having fun</h2><p>This is the ultimate entry-point for greatness. It starts here. It’s just fun to be around companies where everyone knows how to do all of the other things on my list below. You want to be there. You feel encouraged and motivated. It’s a great place to hang out, even after work or on weekends. Fun radiates out of the place, and it is that_allure_that attracts even more talented employees one after the other. Without a sense of fun and creativity, forget ever achieving any level of greatness. To be great, you have to be a beacon.</p>
<h2 id="2-No-one-is-pedantic"><a href="#2-No-one-is-pedantic" class="headerlink" title="2. No one is pedantic"></a>2. No one is pedantic</h2><p>Why am I using such a specific word here? How is it related to great companies? For 26 years, I’ve been involved in multiple organizations and volunteered at many different entities both small and large, and the one thing that seems to kill all progress and creativity is a lack of respect. The sure sign that respect is not common in a company culture is when everyone acts like they know everything. Sure, the mantra “be curious” is important. You can’t be_curious_and_pedantic_at the same time. When the company is filled with people who want to learn new things, it becomes a great place.</p>
<h2 id="3-Empathy-abounds"><a href="#3-Empathy-abounds" class="headerlink" title="3. Empathy abounds"></a>3. Empathy abounds</h2><p>Empathy is an ability to see another point-of-view. When everyone seems to have that ability, look out–that company is going to excel. It’s going to blow the roof off, in fact. We all need each other to help us grow, and empathy is an engine for that. I’m going to help you, you’re going to help me–that’s called<em>teamwork</em>. Sadly, empathy is not that common. Tied closely with that sense of pride and a know-it-all-attitude is a closed mentality that is more about self advancement. I’ve visited hundreds and hundreds of companies, and the one trait that seems to stick out when there’s a bad one is when everyone is trying to advance their own career. Empathy is in short supply, and so is greatness.</p>
<h2 id="4-Expectations-are-crystal-clear-to-everyone"><a href="#4-Expectations-are-crystal-clear-to-everyone" class="headerlink" title="4. Expectations are crystal clear to everyone"></a>4. Expectations are crystal clear to everyone</h2><p>Years ago, I had a boss who never bothered to explain what we were doing or why. Then, he became critical when we didn’t do what he wanted. Huh? Every employee was shooting in the dark with a pop gun. We didn’t know where to aim, when to shoot, or why we were even in the room. As humans, we all want to know<em>why</em>–what’s the vision here? Where are we even going? Why are we doing these things? If that’s crystal clear, then it creates a great company because the entire organization becomes unified. Even more importantly, the goals are clear to everyone involved. It’s not a well-kept secret.</p>
<h2 id="5-Grace-is-prevalent"><a href="#5-Grace-is-prevalent" class="headerlink" title="5. Grace is prevalent"></a>5. Grace is prevalent</h2><p>What happens when employees miss their goals? What if you know where you’re going as an organization but you don’t quite end up getting there in the end? This is where grace is important. I’m convinced that showing grace instead of a demeaning, belittling attitude is what makes a company even greater. I’ll say it’s even more important than having fun. Why is that? Because grace is a license to fail, and being free to try new things and fail at times is what makes people work hard and want to stick around. A culture of criticism kills momentum. A culture of grace, encouragement, understanding, and excitement will turn any organization into a<em>giant</em>.</p>
<h2 id="6-Roles-are-clearly-defined"><a href="#6-Roles-are-clearly-defined" class="headerlink" title="6. Roles are clearly defined"></a>6. Roles are clearly defined</h2><p>“I never know what I’m doing” is a tough predicament for any employee. Employees feel anxious and awkward. You have to set expectations about the<em>why</em>. However, even more important as a starting point for greatness is the idea of role definition. Employee need to feel empowered, and that’s where clear roles come into play. A role is a reason. It’s a way to define why that employee is even at the company and the scope of their involvement. You can’t make expectations until you have informed the employee about how much power he or she can wield. Then, set them loose. Greatness will happen.</p>
<h2 id="7-Everyone-sees-and-rewards-hard-work"><a href="#7-Everyone-sees-and-rewards-hard-work" class="headerlink" title="7. Everyone sees and rewards hard work"></a>7. Everyone sees and rewards hard work</h2><p>I’ve been involved with companies that really know how to recognize employees. On Slack, they’re praising each other all day–in a real way that shows true pride in the accomplishments of others. We communicated! We discussed! We resolved! It’s a team exercise writ large (and in digital form), one that involves frequent pats on the back when there’s a milestone. It’s crazy to think some companies don’t do this. They only acknowledge hard work in rare instances. Most of the time, they are treating employees like cattle that need to be herded–and kicked if they get out of line.</p>
<h2 id="8-Every-employee-is-happy"><a href="#8-Every-employee-is-happy" class="headerlink" title="8. Every employee is happy"></a>8. Every employee is happy</h2><p>Here’s a great way to define happiness at work: An employee is happy when they are perfectly suited to their role. They are challenged enough, placed into the proper department, encouraged constantly to achieve great things, and know their expectations. A happy group of employees creates a dynamic environment. An unhappy group causes constant conflict and stress, which makes the company sink like a stone.</p>
<h2 id="9-Mentoring-is-more-important-than-performance"><a href="#9-Mentoring-is-more-important-than-performance" class="headerlink" title="9. Mentoring is more important than performance"></a>9. Mentoring is more important than performance</h2><p>You know, most of us will figure it out and do great work. Beaten into submission by an angry boss won’t work. Mentoring will. I wanted to list this one as the most important attribute of a great company, but it does fall into second place. (Only a great leader can mentor effectively, so that has to be number one.) Yet, it’s so critical. It’s a way to hand down tacit knowledge. Great companies know how to do that. Great employees know how to mentor one another. They are highly motivated to train others because they know that’s what creates greatness. In fact, that’s really the definition to remember: A great company is one where the most important knowledge is handed down from one employee to the next in a way that’s built on the foundation of<em>individual relationships</em>.</p>
<h2 id="10-There’s-a-great-leader"><a href="#10-There’s-a-great-leader" class="headerlink" title="10. There’s a great leader"></a>10. There’s a great leader</h2><p>I’ve written about this before, but behind every great company there is a great leader. Call it the trickle-down effect of management. Someone at the top practices all of the attributes listed above and demonstrates what it means to show empathy, recognize hard work, and promote mentoring. Greatness happens. A great leader has an attitude that generates enthusiasm and happiness among the staff. It’s contagious.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, we talked about the best<a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/android/best-offline-games-for-android/" target="_blank" rel="external">offline games</a>for Android. We are aware that the listed<a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/vpn/best-gaming-vpn/" target="_blank" rel="external">games</a>were supported on both iOS and Android. In fact, we have yet to come across<a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/android/best-shooter-games-for-android/" target="_blank" rel="external">Android</a>exclusive titles. So that opens a discussion about all the games that have come out on iOS that are playable offline. However, we recommend you check out our Android list after you’re done with this, it lists exceptional offline<a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/android/the-best-android-games-of-2017/" target="_blank" rel="external">games</a>that came out on iOS first and are definitely worth checking out. Here’s our list for the best offline games for iOS that are a one-time purchase.</p>
<h3 id="1-Device-6"><a href="#1-Device-6" class="headerlink" title="1. Device 6"></a>1.

<p>If you remember the choose your own adventure genre of books, Device 6 will seem familiar to you. Since page turning on a tablet is purely an affectation, the multiple award winning (including the coveted Apple Design Award) Device 6 takes it to the next conclusion. The game is a story about solving puzzles and finding your way through a series of choices. Some of those choices will lead to dead-ends and some of those choices will make the story progress.</p>
<p>Each new arc will either ask you to change your device’s orientation to read further, or will require you to scroll back to pick up sounds or other clues. There are no loading screens, no need for saves, it is a linear game with branching arcs. This is a must have for all iOS owners, even if they are not gamers, because it is a first of its kind genre defining game.</p>

<p>This is the game that took Telltale series form an obscure developer to a mainstream medium for title crossovers. Even though their preliminary focus remains on comic and fantasy crossovers today, their biggest foray was bringing back Monkey Island for the modern generation. The episodic concept was not even mainstream at the time. Telltale told the story of Guybrush Threepwood attempting to save himself from becoming a Zombie while protecting his wife Elaine Marley from the zombie pirate LeChuck. The last sequel of this series came out in the year 2000. If you are not familiar with the property, it is a comedy game (and a hilarious one at that) that focuses on puzzle solving to get through. Highly recommended.</p>

<p>This is one of those Tim Shafer strokes of genius. It originally came out on DOS back in 1993 as a sequel to Maniac Mansion that came out in 1987. In fact, you can even play the original game on an old computer. The remastered edition has breathed new life into what was already a timeless classic. The game is a comedy about a sentient tentacle who drinks radioactive water and becomes evil. Our main characters are a loony scientist who created the tentacle and three kids who end up in different eras in time.</p>
<p>You meet the founding fathers of the United States and you are thrust into a totalitarian future where the tentacles rule and humans are treated as pets. Day of The Tentacle is about restoring the timeline and order in the world. Every single puzzle is intriguing, the story is both engrossing and funny, and it is an experience every gamer needs to have at least once in their lives.</p>

<p>This first person adventure game comes from Simogo AB, the people behind Device 6. The game takes the Swedish lore of timewalking and turns it into the core mechanic. Set in the 19th century, the game relies on you to solve puzzles by touching them and seeing a glimpse of the future. The storyline is very immersive and you will be lost in all the creepy detail and atmosphere. The game, much like Device 6, is a bold step that seems to have paid off. It is a fantastic looking game that is both fun to play and immersive to experience.</p>

<p>The success of Minecraft is extraordinary. With a constantly expanding canvas that has now grown larger in size than the planet Neptune, it attracts players from all over the world to build structures out of blocks. If you are not familiar with the property, it is like playing with LEGOs on a computer, with the caveat that you never run out of blocks and you can do practically anything you want. People have recreated entire cities accurately scaled to the last detail, people have created bots (called engineers) to help create large structures for them. Even companies like Verizon have created cell networks within the game, where you can browse the internet and even make video calls (which is a feat of computer engineering on its own, check that out<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdlZRhKmWJY&amp;ab_channel=CaptainSparklez" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>).</p>
<p>If you are interested in creating objects, then this THE game for you. The pocket edition lets you play the game using the touchscreen and gives you the same access as any other platform.</p>

<p>This game originally came out in 1999 and has become a signature series since. Originally it was published by 3DO, now by Ubisoft (They’re up to the VII installment now). It is a turn based strategy game that puts you in the fictional world of fantasy creatures. You choose between mythical factions to strategically wage war against others. An army sent from the divine heavens could be put to fight against the armies of hell. Or you could pit orcs and goblins against elves and dragons. Genies vs Vampires, the list goes on.</p>

<p>The game is a turn-based strategy game. You send a hero out into the world to explore, fight creatures, unearth hidden and protected treasures, and defeat other heroes to become the last player standing. There is a fantastic story mode that takes you to all the realms in the game and a hot seat multiplayer mode that lets as many as 8 players take turns on the same machine. The HD remake keeps all the elements of the original release, only with updated visuals. The original game is played completely using a mouse pointer, which makes touch the ideal evolutionary platform for it.</p>

<p>You are a prisoner in a maximum security facility. Your mission is to escape. You do so by first learning the prison routine. You then craft items that will eventually help you find your way out of the prison. The concept is very simple, yet also very intriguing. It borrows numerous parts of different games like Minecraft and stealth games and combines them to help you escape from the confines of prison.</p>

<p>The LEGO series of games is a widespread genre from simple construction games to complex storylines with mainstream characters. There are crossovers from DC, Marvel, Star Wars, Harry Potter, and numerous others. The games bring a new light to already established properties. There is a fantastic storyline exclusive to the LEGO World. You can replay your favourite moments from franchises like Harry Potter and Star Wars with a LEGO twist, you can patrol Metropolis as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman or Green Lantern, it’s all possible. On top of all that, the games are genuinely fun without being silly. There is campy humor sprinkled here and there, but the games themselves are very true to the source material.</p>

Oceanhorn – Monster of Uncharted Seas</h3><p>Oceanhorn, by the developer’s own admission, is the iOS equivalent of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild the insanely popular title by Nintendo making the rounds on Nintendo Switch and Wii devices. However, Oceanhorn isn’t a cheap attempt at capitalizing on another title’s success, it is thematically close to The Wind Walker.</p>
<p>It is a beautifully crafted game with extremely stunning visuals that truly milk the GPU in your iOS device (especially the iPhone 7/7 Plus). The story is well crafted, the sound is well designed. It is actually a good game on its own merits and should definitely be tried out especially if you are a fan of the Zelda games.</p>

<p>This game will remind of you Lara Craft Go at first glance, because of the eerily similar visuals. However, if you treat it as a standalone title, you will be pleasantly surprised at just how good this game is. The game focuses on both visuals and some interesting puzzles to solve. Games like these are fun to play, as they can be played any time without requiring too much attention while still being entertaining.</p>

    <title>How To Open Recently Quit Apps On macOS</title>

    <updated>2017-06-15T03:35:28.495Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On macOS, closing an app and quitting it are two different things. When you close an app, you close all its windows. When you quit an app, you exit it. The difference is a closed app is technically still running. If you open it again, it will open much faster. Some apps don’t differentiate between closing and quitting. If you close an app, you effectively quit it at the same time.<strong>App Be Back</strong>is a free macOS app that lets you open recently quit apps via a keyboard shortcut. If you recently quit multiple apps, you can re-open them all again in reverse order. App Be Back is like the undo-close for recently closed tabs in your browse, except it works for apps.</p>
<p>Download and run App Be Back. You can undo-quit or open recently quit apps on macOS for all apps you quit after running App Be Back. If you quit an app when App Be Back wasn’t running, it will not be able to re-open it. The app works via a keyboard shortcut, and its menu bar icon.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/mac-os/open-recently-quit-apps/attachment/app-be-back/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://cloud.addictivetips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/app-be-back.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>To open recently quit apps, simply tap the Shift+Command+W keyboard shortcut. This will open the<a href="https://www.addictivetips.com/mac-os/how-to-switch-between-recent-apps-using-the-touch-bar-in-macos/" target="_blank" rel="external">recent app</a>you just quit. If you tap the shortcut again, it will open the app you quit before that last app.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/mac-os/open-recently-quit-apps/attachment/app-be-back-undo-quit/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://cloud.addictivetips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/app-be-back-undo-quit.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>For example, if you quit Safari, Photos, and Calendar in that order, the first time you tap the Shift+Command+W shortcut, it will open the Calendar app. If you tap it a second time, it will open Photos. Tapping it a third time will open Safari.</p>

<p>You can set App Be Back to open at login. You can also customize its shortcut to anything you like. To customize the app’s shortcut, and clear its history, click the app icon in the menu bar.</p>
<p>From the app menu, select ‘Change Keyboard Shortcut’ to record your own shortcut for the app. Select ‘Clear History’ to clear the history of recently closed apps. If you want to set it so that App Be Back runs at login, select ‘Show Intro’ from the app’s menu bar menu. The intro screen has a launch at login option.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/mac-os/open-recently-quit-apps/attachment/app-be-back-preferences/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://cloud.addictivetips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/app-be-back-preferences.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>App Be Back is a pretty neat app to have running. The only thing missing is perhaps an option to hide the app’s menu bar icon. It works perfectly well with just the keyboard shortcut and the menu bar icon is seldom needed. You might need it to change the app’s keyboard shortcut but that’s not a recurring need.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google Assistant is Google’s answer to Siri, or Cortana. Google Assistant is the company’s attempt at a virtual assistant app. Unlike Apple though, Google isn’t restricting it to just Android. There’s already a Google Assistant iOS app which is limited compared to its Android counterpart but it’s there. You won’t see a Siri app for Android any time soon. While Google has made the Google Assistant app available on iOS of its own volition, it hasn’t released a desktop app for it. This is why you can’t get Google Assistant on macOS or Windows the same way you can get Siri and Cortana respectively.</p>
<p>The good news is, the developer community is on it.<strong>MacAssistant</strong>is a free open-source Mac app that lets you use Google Assistant on macOS. The app is still in beta but it works reasonably well.</p>
<p>Download MacAssistant. The developer isn’t verified so if you’re running the latest version of macOS, you won’t be able to run the app by just double-clicking it. Instead, open it Finder. Hold down the Ctrl key and then click the app. Select ‘Open’ from the context menu and the app will open.</p>

<p>MacAssistant runs from the Menu bar. Click the app icon in the Menu bar and sign in to your Google account.</p>

<p>We should warn you now that this app will have broad control over your Google account. It’s not something to worry about given the app is open source.</p>
<p>After you sign in, click the Menu bar button again. In the pop-up that opens, click the mic button and<a href="https://www.addictivetips.com/android/get-google-assistant-android-phone/" target="_blank" rel="external">Google Assistant</a>will ‘listen’ for your command. You don’t need to give the app additional access to your mic as it already has access to it.</p>

<p>Commands at present are limited but you can ask it general questions like what the weather’s like outside.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/mac-os/get-google-assistant-on-macos/attachment/google-assistant-2/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://cloud.addictivetips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/google-assistant-1.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The answer to whatever you ask Google Assistant is spoken back to you. There’s no UI for it just now. If you have the volume turned down, you won’t be able to use MacAssistant in its present form.</p>
<p>Like the earlier versions of Google Assistant, MacAssistant works only with voice input. Unlike the app on Android which now lets you<a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/android/input-text-in-google-assistant/" target="_blank" rel="external">input text in Google Assistant</a>, MacAssistant works only with voice commands. The app is still in its infancy so while we may have a wishlist of features, it’s not really fair to bring it up considering the app’s only been around for a week. It’s in active development so you can expect it to improve exponentially.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Mac App Store and the iTunes App Store both ask for your password when you download an app. You will be asked to enter your Apple ID password regardless if you’re buying an app or downloading a free one. This is done in part to prevent unauthorized purchases. It’s also a good deterrent for when the kids go wild on the App Store. The only problem is that it can get annoying. If you don’t want to enter your password for free app downloads, you can save it. Likewise, if you’re regretting this decision, you can remove your Apple ID password for free purchases. Here’s how you can store or remove your Apple ID password for free purchases in macOS.</p>
<h3 id="Store-Apple-ID-Password-For-Free-Purchases"><a href="#Store-Apple-ID-Password-For-Free-Purchases" class="headerlink" title="Store Apple ID Password For Free Purchases"></a>Store Apple ID Password For Free Purchases</h3><p>There are two ways to go about this. One, open the Mac App Store app and look for a free app. Click the ‘Get’ button and enter your Apple ID password when prompted.</p>
<p>The Mac App Store app will prompt you to save your password for future free purchases. It’s very much like your browser asking to store login credentials for a website.</p>
<p>When you see the ‘Save Password for Free Items’ prompt, click ‘Yes’.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/mac-os/apple-id-password-for-free-purchases-macos/attachment/app-store-macos-password/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://cloud.addictivetips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/app-store-macos-password.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>If the prompt doesn’t appear, you can use the second method.</p>
<p>Open the System Preferences app. Click the App Store preference. At the very bottom is an option called ‘Free Downloads’. Open the drop-down next to it and select ‘Save Password’. macOS might prompt you to enter your Apple ID password. This will not affect paid app downloads. You will still be asked to enter your password when you buy an app.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/mac-os/apple-id-password-for-free-purchases-macos/attachment/system-preferences-for-macos/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://cloud.addictivetips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/system-preferences-for-macos.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<h3 id="Remove-Apple-ID-Password-For-Free-Purchases"><a href="#Remove-Apple-ID-Password-For-Free-Purchases" class="headerlink" title="Remove Apple ID Password For Free Purchases"></a>Remove Apple ID Password For Free Purchases</h3><p>Open System Preferences and select ‘App Store’. At the bottom of this preference pane open the Free Downloads drop-down. Select the ‘Require Password’ option. The next time you download a free app from the Mac App Store, you will have to enter you Apple ID password.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/mac-os/apple-id-password-for-free-purchases-macos/attachment/remove-app-store-password-for-free-apps/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://cloud.addictivetips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/remove-app-store-password-for-free-apps.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>This option has its pros and cons. The pro here is that you don’t need to verify your identity when you download a free app. A free app, by and large, will not create a problem for you. The con is that even free apps can be problematic in terms of content. If you don’t want to save your Apple ID password for free apps to protect minors who might use your Mac, consider using parental controls instead of removing your Apple ID password.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple released macOS Sierra in 2016 and the major feature in this version was the inclusion of Siri on the desktop. Plenty of other smaller features were also part of the update but Siri on the desktop was something people had been anticipating for quite some time. Another major update from Apple came in the form of the new Macbooks which have a new hardware component called the Touch Bar. It has mixed reviews but developers have been hard a work adding support for the Touch Bar. Here are the 10 best macOS apps and tips of 2016.</p>

<p>Rebranding is an incredible challenge for any company, and the uniqueness of the task guarantees there will always be new things to learn. You might say that some of the lessons are well-known, but how they apply – and how they impact you – can offer refreshing insight.</p>
<p>As a company president who is currently leading an organization through a rebrand, I’m hoping to pass on a few tips for how entrepreneurs, businessleadersand managers can navigate similar waters without fear of capsizing.</p>

<p>The company, which was founded with the name Allied Trade Group, started as several websites that all rolled in to the same business, originally branded as ATGStores.com. But, as the home furnishings industry changed, it became clear to us that “ATG” would have to change, too. Here are 10 things we learned in becoming The Mine – now a premier online destination for unique fine furnishings and décor.</p>
<h2 id="1-Changing-your-company-name-isn’t-going-to-solve-all-your-problems"><a href="#1-Changing-your-company-name-isn’t-going-to-solve-all-your-problems" class="headerlink" title="1. Changing your company name isn’t going to solve all your problems."></a>1. Changing your company name isn’t going to solve all your problems.</h2><p>When we first started to talk about rebranding the company, we knew our name wasn’t our only issue, but it was part of the puzzle. We knew the ATG acronym was confusing and hard for customers to remember; however, a new name wasn’t going to be a magic Band-Aid that resulted<a href="https://www.marketingweek.com/2016/06/30/how-to-create-a-sticky-brand/&#39;" target="_blank" rel="external">in instant organic traffic and a sticky brand</a>.</p>
<p>Before you rebrand your company, you need to reevaluate your overall strategy and offering.</p>
<p>We used data and customer insights to accomplish several things: We redefined<a href="https://www.marketingweek.com/2016/06/30/how-to-create-a-sticky-brand/&#39;" target="_blank" rel="external">our target audience</a>, established a new strategy for our products and services, and created a plan to overhaul the look and feel of the website. It took us two years to take our offering from 4 million to 1 million items, and refine the selection with a focus on high-quality, design-forward brands.</p>

<p>We also added and improved services to support those brands. We now offer one-on-one service through our personal concierge team, professional installation and assembly services, more robust pro services and access to design partners who provide original content and designinspiration. Once we had that in place, we felt confident we were ready to reintroduce ourselves as The Mine.</p>
<h2 id="2-Finding-the-perfect-name-requires-a-process-of-exploration-and-elimination"><a href="#2-Finding-the-perfect-name-requires-a-process-of-exploration-and-elimination" class="headerlink" title="2. Finding the perfect name requires a process of exploration and elimination."></a>2. Finding the perfect name requires a process of exploration and elimination.</h2><p>It’s best to know what names aren’t available for sale or aren’t within your budget before you start planning. Brainstorming is great, but it’s also good to focus that effort in ways that will result in a usable concept.</p>
<p>I think people probably imagine a very creative process, and it is, but it’s also very methodical. Or, it probably should be to make sure you’ve uncovered and considered every available option.</p>
<h2 id="3-Don’t-put-too-many-cooks-in-the-kitchen"><a href="#3-Don’t-put-too-many-cooks-in-the-kitchen" class="headerlink" title="3. Don’t put too many cooks in the kitchen."></a>3. Don’t put too many cooks in the kitchen.</h2><p>Choosing a new name isn’t easy. It’s important to have a team involved in the selection process, but you have to be strategic about it. Having both internal and external players helps gain perspective, but less is often more in this kind of situation.</p>

Give your team as much info as you can, as soon as you can."></a>4. Give your team as much info as you can, as soon as you can.</h2><p>Once you’re ready to share with your team, be sure to explain why, how and when you’re rebranding, and maybe do it sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>We announced ourrebrandingas The Mine to the team about two months prior to launch, and we learned right away that we should’ve given them more time with the concept. The rebranding team felt very familiar with it because they’d been working on it for so long, but the extended team was surprised by the news. They had a lot of questions, and we learned we needed to more thoroughly explain the “why’s” moving forward.</p>
<h2 id="5-It’s-important-to-realize-you’ll-never-be-100-percent-ready"><a href="#5-It’s-important-to-realize-you’ll-never-be-100-percent-ready" class="headerlink" title="5. It’s important to realize you’ll never be 100 percent ready."></a>5. It’s important to realize you’ll never be 100 percent ready.</h2><p>There are always going to be more projects and ongoing improvements, and you’ll keep thinking,Let’s just check one more box before we rebrand. It’s important to draw a clear line in the sand and to go for it, knowing there will always be more items you’ll want to complete. If you wait until you’re 100 percent ready to rebrand, you’ll end up waiting forever.</p>
<h2 id="6-Getting-team-buy-in-is-critical-to-the-success-of-a-rebrand"><a href="#6-Getting-team-buy-in-is-critical-to-the-success-of-a-rebrand" class="headerlink" title="6. Getting team buy-in is critical to the success of a rebrand."></a>6. Getting team buy-in is critical to the success of a rebrand.</h2><p>Every rebrand has an internal and external component, and they’re both equally important. We received a lot of feedback from team members who were unsure about the rebrand; they liked ATG, and they were proud to be a part of that.</p>
<p>Of course, loved hearing that, and we realized we needed to find a way to let people know that they were a part of it, and that – at the end of the day – we weren’t changing as a family. So, we call ourselves The Minds Behind The Mine. We all have a part, and each is as valued as the next.</p>

<li>When you’re trying to establish name recognition, sometimes it helps to partner with someone who already has a recognizable name.</li>
</ol>
<p>We invited Alexa Hampton, design icon and owner of the Manhattan-based design firm Mark Hampton LLC, to be our creative director early on in the rebrand, and she has been an invaluable resource.</p>
<p>She participated directly in the creative process, which helped give her some ownership in that. And so, when it came time to promote it, she was ready with plenty of stories to tell. It was great for us, because she’s a respected member of the design community, and it was good for her because she got to help shape the destiny of a company – kind of a big deal.</p>
<h2 id="8-You-should-be-willing-to-let-the-process-take-you-in-unexpected-directions"><a href="#8-You-should-be-willing-to-let-the-process-take-you-in-unexpected-directions" class="headerlink" title="8. You should be willing to let the process take you in unexpected directions."></a>8. You should be willing to let the process take you in unexpected directions.</h2><p>We hired abrandingfirm to make sure we didn’t get stuck in a rut with our thinking, and they helped us decide on a look for the logo and lettering by creating three different buckets: “bold,” “unexpected” and “traditional.”</p>
<p>It was incredibly helpful, because once we saw our options (and there were hundreds) we knew right away we weren’t going traditional. The firm pulled from several different industries, and our style definitely borrows from fashion and beauty, perhaps even more than furniture, but that’s what makes sense for The Mine.</p>

Consider the possibility that less is more in your design."></a>9. Consider the possibility that less is more in your design.</h2><p>In the beginning, there was a feeling that we had to include an image of some kind in our logo messaging, just to make sure people understood exactly what we were about. But, after much research and testing, we decided we didn’t want to oversell it, or make it look like we were trying too hard.</p>
<p>And, that ended up being a great call. Now, we have a name and logo with more versatility, and it invites our customers to explore a little bit. It’s also got a more exclusive feel, which can be hard to convey once you start using imagery.</p>

Go for it, own it and make sure your team has fun doing it!</p>
<p>The Minds Behind the Mine are so excited to announce our rebrand and hear what the world has to say. We want to welcome everyone to<a href="https://www.themine.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">The Mine</a>so we can share our hard work with our audience, and show them how we make it easy to get the home you crave.  </p>

    <title>The MAYA Principle: Design for the Future, but Balance it with Your Users’ Present</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Learn todesign for the future, while balancing your design with your users’ present stage of skills andmindset. This is called theMAYA Principle and it’s the secret behind theindustrial design of the Coca-Cola bottle, Shell Oil logo, and the Greyhound logo.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.interaction-design.org/images/ux-daily/d2297af38d2226cd956a17baa2d08893.jpg" alt="">Author/Copyright holder: Raymond Loewy. Copyright terms and licence: All rights reserved</p>
<p>Designs and drawings by Raymond Loewy who designed the Air Force One logo, the Coca-Cola bottle, the Shell Oil logo, the US Postal Service logo, and the Greyhound logo.</p>
<p>Why not learn from the best design experts with the most impressive track record? Raymond Loewy (1893-1986) is often referred to as the father of Industrial Design and his track record is indeed impressive. The Air Force One logo, the Coca-Cola bottle, the Shell Oil logo, the US Postal Service logo, the Greyhound logo are just some of his impressive designs which still exist today.</p>
<p>Today, Loewy can still teach us to design our products with just the rightbalance between the well-known present, on onehand, and a new and innovative future on the other hand. If we don’t hit the right balance, our users won’t embrace nor buy our products, Loewy emphasized.</p>
<h2 id="The-MAYA-Principle"><a href="#The-MAYA-Principle" class="headerlink" title="The MAYA Principle"></a>The MAYA Principle</h2><p>Loewy’s secret was essential to design for the future – but delivering the future gradually. He designed his famous logos, some of the most recognizable cars of the 40s, 50s, and 60s, refrigerators, and locomotives for his users’ present needs and skills while pushing the boundaries of design and technology beyond his users’expectations. He called this approach the MAYA principle. Maya is an abbreviation for“<strong>Most Advanced. Yet Acceptable.</strong>” which means that Loewy sought to give his users the most advanced design, but not more advanced than what they were able to accept and embrace. Loewy believed that:</p>
<p>“The adult public’s taste is not necessarily ready to accept the logical solutions to their requirements if the solution implies too vast a departure from what they have been conditioned into accepting as the norm.”</p>

<p>The early iPod is a good example of how Apple applied the MAYA principle. The iPod’s designers gradually pushed theproduct design further and further as the iPod gradually lost the extra buttons and got a more streamlined interface. It is very likely that this gradual development from the first iPod in 2001 was what made the iPhone acceptable to users when it was launched in 2007. By applying the MAYA principle, the designers at Apple provided the users with the most advanced design within the boundaries of their acceptance.</p>

<p>The Newton tablet was an early personal digital assistant and the first tablet platform developed by Apple. Apple started developing the tablet in 1987. It was launched in 1993 and cancelled in 1998 as it was a financial disaster for Apple. There were several reasons that the Newton tablet did not become a success, but one of the main reasons could well be that the Newton tablet was introduced without users being familiar with a digital personal assistant.</p>
<p>A more recent example is Google Glass which has not become the success it was anticipated to become. Maybe it’s because the whole concept of wearing glasses that both record everything we do – while augmenting what we see with a layer of information – is simply too advanced for us. Maybe we need to take gradual steps before being ready to embrace this new technology. So the question is, how do we learn to strike the right balance between the most advanced design and our users’ ability to accept our product?</p>

<p>The lack of success for both Apple’s Newton tablet and Google Glass could be that they were too advanced for their users.</p>
<h2 id="How-You-Can-Apply-the-MAYA-Principle-in-Your-Everyday-Design-Work"><a href="#How-You-Can-Apply-the-MAYA-Principle-in-Your-Everyday-Design-Work" class="headerlink" title="How You Can Apply the MAYA Principle in Your Everyday Design Work"></a>How You Can Apply the MAYA Principle in Your Everyday Design Work</h2><p>Most of us have experienced the frustrating feeling of trying to explain and sell a great design solution and not get the buy-in from our management or clients. Maybe the design solution was too advanced? Or too much like the old design? Next time, you should consider using the MAYA principle to strike the right balance.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advance your design gradually over time</strong><br>as the Apple designers did with their development of the iPod. Do not make a lot of major changes right away as you risk scaring off your users. You need to ask yourself what context your users are familiar with and which features has to be changed. When in doubt you should distinguish between: Nice to have and need to have.</li>
<li><strong>Include familiar patterns in the visual design</strong><br>so users can orient themselves just like Apple’s designers gradually made the iPod more and more streamlined and eventually launched the ultra-streamlined iPhone.</li>
<li><strong>Draw on your user’s present skills and mindset</strong><br>while presenting them with only a carefully chosen few major changes.</li>
<li>A golden rule is that<br><strong>if you have to explain your product design</strong><br>and if you need to include a manual or elaborate “help” features, your product is overly advanced or too complex to use. Your users should be able to understand and use your product instantly or at least with little training and explanation. Your users will lose confidence in the product and in themselves if they need to read a thick manual to understand it. We will explain how to find the right balance further down based on the theory of psychologist Lev Vygotsky.</li>
<li><p>The MAYA principle resonates with many design principles and heuristics such as the “<br>Match between the system and the real world” from Jakob Nielsen’s list of heuristics (</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heur…</a><br><strong>).</strong></p>
</li>
<li>The MAYA principle<br>also resonates with the use of libraries and design patterns when designing interactions: By using standard libraries and design patterns, you can increase the level of familiarity that the users will have with your design. That can be helpful if you aim to push the boundaries in some aspects of your design, i.e. if you intentionally depart from the norm in some aspects of your design.</li>

It’s fundamental to how human beings learn new skills and insights.</p>
<p>Among educators, the Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard (1813-1855) is often quoted for emphasizing the fact that when you want to help someone learn a new skill (or product), you first need to find out about the person’s present skill level. You need to find out what’s acceptable to them before teaching them anything new and advanced. Otherwise your efforts (and your design of a new product) will not be worth anything. For instance, there is no reason to teach a child to spell the word “philosophical” if the child has not learned what an alphabet is and what it means. The first step is always to find out what is “acceptable” for the learner and user.</p>

<p>There’s no need to teach a child to spell the word “philosophical” if the child has not learned what an alphabet is and what it means. The first step is always to find out what is “acceptable” for the learner and user.</p>
<p>How advanced and innovative can you then make your new product or design? To answer that question, you can use the principle called the<strong>zone of proximal development (ZPD).</strong>The term was developed by the Soviet psychologist and founder of cultural-historical psychology, Lev Semyonovich Vygotsky (1896-1934).Vygotsky’s term zone of proximal development describes the range of skills that a child is in the process of learning.</p>
<p>Vygotsky stated that a child follows an adult’s example and gradually develops the ability to do certain tasks without help. Vygotsky believed that the role of education is to give children experiences that are within their zones of proximal development, thereby encouraging and advancing their individual learning.We will tell you how you can use that in a design process, but first you need some more background on the ZPD.</p>
<p>The lower limit of the ZPDis the maximum level of skill which a child can acquire by working independently (the child’s actual developmental level). This can be compared to your users’ present level of skills and the skills they are (easily) able to learn by themselves. This would mean small changes in an existing product, or a new product with a strong similarity to existing products or interaction patterns.</p>
<p>The upper limit of the ZPDis the maximum level of skills that the child is able to reach with the assistance of a more capable instructor. Vygotsky emphasized that you can only help the child, i.e. your user, through gradual steps of evolving new skills and understandings. A first-grade teacher will, of course, know that a child will learn to spell even the most complex words in the future. But you don’t present the child with long complex words to begin with. You start gradually by presenting the child with the letter A, then the letter B, and so forth. You always have to aim for only the next reachable zone of development.</p>
<p>What you can learn from Vygotsky is that you have to distinguish between:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your user’s lower limit of ZPD – i.e. what she can easily learn by herself, without your help, without a manual, or without an instructor’s help.</li>
<li>Your user’s upper limit of ZPD – i.e. what she can learn with the help of an instructor or manual.</li>
</ul>
<p>When seeking the right balance you should remember that a child most often has to attend school. Your users don’t have to buy your product. Maybe some users are forced to use your products at work, but you should strongly consider if you design for the lower or upper limit of ZPD. Do you want your users to read manuals or to require instruction before being able to use your product, or do you want them to be able to easily teach themselves new functions?</p>
<p>The MAYA principle advocates for designing with the lower limit of ZPD in mind if you want your product to succeed. Most often, users will not spend their valuable time and money by learning how to use your new product if they can find a product which is easier to use.At the same time, users are often attracted to shiny new products with advanced features - designed with the future in mind. Finding the right balance could be the determining factor that will decide if your next product will become a success.</p>

    <updated>2017-06-14T03:43:53.575Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Each ecommerce site has its owncheckout flowmoving the user from a shopping cart to the final purchase. This differs based on what the user is buying and their intentions, but finalizing payment is always the toughest part.</p>
<p>Your<strong>billing fields</strong>need to really keep visitors engaged and encourage them to complete the checkout process. I’d like to share some usability tips you can follow to improve yourbilling form designs and increase user checkout conversions.</p>
<h2 id="Clarify-Intent"><a href="#Clarify-Intent" class="headerlink" title="Clarify Intent"></a>Clarify Intent</h2><p>Your goal is to design forms that encourage users to buy. So you want to make this process as simple as possible, especially at the billing phase where money is on the line.</p>
<p>There is no single way to clarify an entire billing form. You just need to keep each field clear and concise, never let the user feel confused or unsure of their decision to check out.</p>
<p>Here are some techniques you should keep in mind that work well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Larger typography</li>
<li>Labels instead of placeholders(or both)</li>
<li>Extra padding between fields</li>
<li>Custom<br><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/tabindex" target="_blank" rel="external">tabindex</a><br> for easier navigation</li>
</ul>
<p>Also add plenty of icons to demonstrate visuals where needed. The<a href="https://www.threadless.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Threadless checkout page</a>offers a great example.</p>
<p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/MBbAjyF.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>The credit card icons make it crystal clear what the user is selecting as a payment method. The same goes for icons lower in the field which clarify the location of CVV numbers.</p>
<p>Do everything in your power to let the user know exactly what they’re doing at each stage of the billing form. There should be no ambiguous terms, no unclear directions, and plenty of tooltips/icons to answer any questions along the way.</p>
<h2 id="Custom-Input-Spacing"><a href="#Custom-Input-Spacing" class="headerlink" title="Custom Input Spacing"></a>Custom Input Spacing</h2><p>Some data requires a certain text format like phone numbers and credit cards. This spacing can be dynamically generated on-the-fly using JavaScript and it’s one of the best techniques you can add to your website.</p>
<p>Custom spacing lets users know they’re on the right track when filling out form fields.</p>
<p>You can do this with zip codes where the form automatically tabs onto the next field once the user enters the proper digits for a zip code. Same with phone numbers where you can auto-style the digits to match a phone number. You can see this on eBay’s checkout form.</p>
<p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/JFZRNzf.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>But the most useful is the credit card 4-digit spacing format. Credit card numbers are long and they’re easy to screw up. An incorrect CC number also means the order will completely backfire.</p>
<p>This custom CC spacing in your billing field makes it that much easier for customers to enter their numbers and double-check that they’re correct. You can find a nice example on the<a href="https://www.bodybuilding.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">BodyBuilding checkout screen</a>which also includes error messages when you have an invalid entry.</p>
<p><img src="http://img1.tuicool.com/byumeaz.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>There are tons of free plugins you can use to create the auto-formatted text. Most run on jQuery but you can find some vanilla JS solutions too.</p>
<p>These are the best ones I’ve found:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jessepollak.github.io/card/" target="_blank" rel="external">Card.js</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wangjohn.github.io/creditly/" target="_blank" rel="external">Creditly.js</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/lopezton/jquery-creditcard-formatter" target="_blank" rel="external">jQuery Card Formatter</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Simplify-The-Action"><a href="#Simplify-The-Action" class="headerlink" title="Simplify The Action"></a>Simplify The Action</h2><p>Some checkout forms are longer than others so the process always feels different for every website. This can be confusing for many visitors and it’s one reason why ecommerce stalled for so long in the early 2000s.</p>
<p>But regardless of your form’s length there are two ways to design around this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Smaller forms should try to keep everything on one page for simplicity</li>
<li>Larger billing forms should break into steps with breadcrumbs</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the smaller billing form on SEMrush is fantastic. Very quick to use, easy to read and everything you need to know is clearly visible on the page.</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/Qf6Zz2Q.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>But I don’t mind a longer checkout process so long as it hasbreadcrumbs. These offer a clear indicator of how far the user has traveled into the checkout process and how much longer they have before completion.</p>
<p>This confidence makes it easier for someone to commit to the billing form at each step. If they have no idea when the checkout process ends they might get confused, anxious, or just annoyed and leave.</p>
<p>Breadcrumbs are huge and I absolutely recommend adding them to larger billing forms. The<a href="https://www.wiggle.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Wiggle</a>checkout uses clear breadcrumbs at the top of each form page.</p>
<p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/rUBJzuY.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>Smaller &amp; larger billing forms can work well just varying different techniques. Be willing to try both!</p>
<p>Run someA/B split testsand see which style performs better. You might be surprised at the results.</p>
<h2 id="Recap-The-Purchase"><a href="#Recap-The-Purchase" class="headerlink" title="Recap The Purchase"></a>Recap The Purchase</h2><p>Once the user enters their billing information it can be tough to hit that final “submit” button. Hesitation is the death of conversion.</p>
<p>By recapping the purchase order you give customers a final peace of mind. They can see everything at once from the items they’re purchasing to the total fees(plus processing) and even the delivery date if applicable.</p>
<p>GitHub’s pro upgrade billing field recaps the purchase all on one page. It clarifies how often you’ll be billed, what the final fee is, and when you can expect the next fee. Most fields are filled out from your profile so if you have an account this process is very quick.</p>
<p><img src="http://img1.tuicool.com/ZjeiMzN.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>Another example is Amazon, the mother of all ecommerce shops.</p>
<p>Once you enter all your details like shipping address &amp; payment info, one final screen recaps the whole order to make sure you really understand what you’re purchasing.</p>
<p>This reduces returns for wrong items and helps the customer feel confident when they press that “purchase” button.</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/FNrEnuq.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>Recapping the order can be tough on a smaller billing form. But just be<strong>openly transparent</strong>with your customers and share as much detail as possible.</p>
<h4 id="Wrapping-Up"><a href="#Wrapping-Up" class="headerlink" title="Wrapping Up"></a>Wrapping Up</h4><p>Your site’s billing form is the only thing standing between a potential customer and a paying customer. That’s whyform optimizationis so important.</p>
<p>I hope these trends can help you craft usable and encouraging billing forms that’ll bring more revenue to your shop and all of your clients. Optimization is an ongoing process but if you’re constantly testing new ideas you’ll always be ahead of the competition.</p>

    <title>Is the keyboard faster than the mouse?</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Is the keyboard faster than the mouse?</strong></p>
<p>Which is faster, keyboard or mouse? A large number of programmers believe that the keyboard is faster for all (programming-related) tasks. However, there are a few widely cited webpages that claim that “studies” show that using the mouse is faster than using the keyboard for everything and that people who think that using the keyboard is faster are just deluding themselves. This might sound extreme, but, just for example, one page says that the author has “never seen [the keyboard] outperform the mouse”.</p>
<p>But it can’t be the case that the mouse is faster for everything – almost no one is faster at clicking on an on-screen keyboard with a mouse than typing at a physical keyboard. Conversely, there are tasks for which mice are much better suited than keyboards (e.g., aiming in FPS games). For someone without an agenda, the question shouldn’t be, which is faster at all tasks, but which tasks are faster with a keyboard, which are faster with a mouse, and which are faster when both are used?</p>
<p>To start, let’s look at the cited studies to see where the mouse is really faster. Most references on the web, when followed all the way back, point to the AskTog, a site by<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Tognazzini" target="_blank" rel="external">Bruce Tognazzini</a>, who describes himself as a “recognized leader in human/computer interaction design”.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.asktog.com/TOI/toi06KeyboardVMouse1.html" target="_blank" rel="external">The most cited AskTog page on the topic claims that they’ve spent $50M of R&amp;D and done all kinds of studies</a>; the page claims that, among other things, the $50M in R&amp;D showed “Test subjects consistently report that keyboarding is faster than mousing” and “The stopwatch consistently proves mousing is faster than keyboarding. ”. The claim is that this both proves that the mouse is faster than the keyboard, and explains why programmers think the keyboard is faster than the mouse even though it’s slower. However, the result unreproducible because “Tog” doesn’t not only doesn’t cite the details of the experiments, Tog doesn’t even describe the experiments and just makes a blanket claim.</p>
<p>The<a href="http://www.asktog.com/TOI/toi22KeyboardVMouse2.html" target="_blank" rel="external">second widely cited AskTog page</a>is in response to a response to the previous page, and it simply repeats that the first page showed that keyboard shortcuts are slower. While there’s a lot of sarcasm, like “Perhaps we have all been misled these years. Perhaps the independent studies that show over and over again that Macintosh users are more productive, can learn quicker, buy more software packages, etc., etc., etc., are somehow all flawed. Perhaps….” no actual results are cited, as before. There is, however, a psuedo-scientific explanation of why the mouse is faster than the keyboard:</p>
<p>Command Keys Aren’t Faster. As you know from my August column, it takes just as long to decide upon a command key as it does to access the mouse. The difference is that the command-key decision is a high-level cognitive function of which there is no long-term memory generated. Therefore, subjectively, keys seem faster when in fact they usually take just as long to use.</p>
<p>Since mouse acquisition is a low-level cognitive function, the user need not abandon cognitive process on the primary task during the acquisition period. Therefore, the mouse acquirer achieves greater productivity.</p>
<p>One question this raises is, why should typing on the keyboard be any different from using command keys? There certainly are people who aren’t fluent at touch typing who have to think about which key they’re going to press when they type. Those people are very slow typists, perhaps even slower than someone who’s quick at using the mouse to type via an on screen keyboard. But there are also people who are fluent with the keyboard and can type without consciously thinking about which keys they’re going to press. The implicit claim here is that it’s not possible to be fluent with command keys in the same way it’s possible to be fluent with the keyboard for typing. It’s possible that’s true, but I find the claim to be highly implausible, both in principle, and from having observed people who certainly seem to be fluent with command keys, and the claim has no supporting evidence.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.asktog.com/SunWorldColumns/S02KeyboardVMouse3.html" target="_blank" rel="external">The third widely cited AskTog page cites a single experiment</a>, where the author typed a paragraph and then had to replace every “e” with a “|”, either using cursor keys or the mouse. The author found that the average time for using cursor keys was 99.43 seconds and the average time for the mouse was 50.22 seconds. No information about the length of the paragraph or the number of “e”s was given. The third page was in response to a user who cited specific editing examples where they found that they were faster with a keyboard than with a mouse.</p>
<p>My experience with benchmarking is that the vast majority of microbenchmarks have wrong or misleading results because they’re difficult to set up properly, and even when set up properly, understanding how the microbenchmark results relate to real-world world results requires a deep understanding of the domain. As a result, I’m deeply skeptical of broad claims that come from microbenchmarks unless the author has a demonstrated, deep, understanding of benchmarking their particular domain, and even then I’ll ask why they believe their result generalizes. The opinion that microbenchmarks are very difficult to interpret properly is<a href="https://twitter.com/shipilev/status/709982588673388544" target="_blank" rel="external">widely shared among people who understand benchmarking</a>.</p>
<p>The<code>e -&gt; |</code>replacement task described is not only a microbenchmark, it’s a bizarrely artificial microbenchmark.</p>
<p>Based on the times given in the result, the task was either for very naive users, or disallowed any kind of search and replace functionality. This particular AskTog column is in response to a programmer who mentioned editing tasks, so the microbenchmark is meaningless unless that programmer is trapped in an experiment where they’re not allowed to use their editor’s basic functionality. Moreover, the replacement task itself is unrealistic – how often do people replace<code>e</code>with<code>|</code>?</p>
<p>I timed this task without the bizarre no-search-and-replace restriction removed and got the following results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keyboard shortcut: 1.26s</li>
<li>M-x, “replace-string” (instead of using mapped keyboard shortcut): 2.8s</li>
<li>Navigate to search and replace with mouse: 5.39s</li>
</ul>
<p>The first result was from using a keyboard shortcut. The second result is something I might do if I were in someone else’s emacs setup, which has different keyboard shortcuts mapped; emacs lets you run a command by hitting “M-x” and typing the entire name of the command. That’s much slower than using a keyboard shortcut directly, but still faster than using the mouse (at least for me, here) Does this mean that keyboards are great and mice are terrible? No, the result is nearly totally meaningless because I spend almost none of my time doing single-character search-and-replace, making the speed of single-character search-and-replace irrelevant.</p>
<p>Also, since I’m used to using the keyboard, the mouse speed here is probably unusually slow. That’s doubly true here because my normal editor setup (<code>emacs -nw</code>) doesn’t allow for mouse usage, so I ended up using an unfamiliar editor,<code>TextEdit</code>, for the mouse test. I did each task once in order to avoid “practicing” the exact task, which could unrealistically make the keyboard-shortcut version nearly instantaneous because it’s easy to hit a practiced sequence of keys very quickly. However, this meant that I was using an unfamiliar mouse in an unfamiliar set of menus for the mouse. Furthermore, like many people who’ve played FPS games in the distant past, I’m used to having “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=mouse+acceleration" target="_blank" rel="external">mouse acceleration</a>” turned off, but the Mac has this on by default and I didn’t go through the rigmarole necessary to disable mouse acceleration. Additionally, recording program I used (quicktime) made the entire machine laggy, which probably affects mousing speed more than keyboard speed, and the menu setup for the program I happened to use forced me to navigate through two levels of menus.</p>
<p>That being said, despite not being used to the mouse, if I want to find a microbenchmark where I’m faster with the mouse than with the keyboard, that’s easy: let me try selecting a block of text that’s on the screen but not near my cursor:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keyboard: 1.8s</li>
<li>Mouse: 0.7s</li>
</ul>
<p>I tend to do selection of blocks in emacs by searching for something at the start of the block, setting a mark, and then searching for something at the end of the mark. I typically type three characters to make sure that I get a unique chunk of text (and I’ll type more if it’s text where I don’t think three characters will cut it). This makes the selection task somewhat slower than the replacement task because the replacement task used single characters and this task used multiple characters.</p>
<p>The mouse is so much better suited for selecting a block of text that even with an unfamiliar mouse setup where I end up having to make a correction instead of being able to do the selection in one motion, the mouse is over twice as fast. But, if I wanted select something that was off screen and the selection was so large that it wouldn’t fit on one screen, the keyboard time wouldn’t change and the mouse time would get much slower, making the keyboard faster.</p>
<p>In addition to doing the measurements, I also (informally) polled people to ask if they thought the keyboard or the mouse would be faster for specific tasks. Both search-and-replace and select-text are tasks where the result was obvious to most people. But not all tasks are obvious; scrolling was one where people didn’t have strong opinions one way or another. Let’s look at scrolling, which is a task both the keyboard and the mouse are well suited for. To have something concrete, let’s look at scrolling down 4 pages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keyboard: 0.49s</li>
<li>Mouse: 0.57s</li>
</ul>
<p>While there’s some difference, and I suspect that if I repeated the experiment enough times I could get a statistically significant result, but the difference is small enough that the difference isn’t of practical significance.</p>
<p>Contra Tog’s result, which was that everyone believes the keyboard was faster even though the mouse is faster, I find that people are pretty good at estimating what’s which device is faster for which tasks and also at estimate when both devices will give a similar result. One possible reason is that I’m polling programmers, and in particular, programmers at<a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=b504af89e87b77920c9b60b2a1f6d5e8" target="_blank" rel="external">RC</a>, who are probably a different population than whoever Tog might’ve studied in his studies. He was in a group that was looking at how to design the UI for a general purpose computer in the 80s, where it would have been actually been unreasonable to focus on studying people, many of whom grew up using computers, and then chose a career where you use computers all day. The equivalent population would’ve had to start using computers in the 60s or even earlier, but even if they had, input devices were quite different (the ball mouse wasn’t invented until 1972, and it certainly wasn’t in wide use the moment it was invented). There’s nothing wrong with studying populations who aren’t relatively expert at using computer input devices, but there is something wrong with generalizing those results to people who are relatively expert.</p>
<p>Unlike claims by either keyboard or mouse advocates, when I do experiments myself, the results are mixed. Some tasks are substantially faster if I use the keyboard and some are substantially faster if I use the mouse. Moreover, most of the results are easily predictable (when the results are similar, the prediction is that it would be hard to predict). If we look at the most widely cited, authoritative, results on the web, we find that they make very strong claims that the mouse is much faster than the keyboard but back up the claim with nothing but a single, bogus, experiment. It’s possible that some of the vaunted $50M in R&amp;D went into valid experiments, but those experiments, if they exist, aren’t cited.</p>
<p>I spent some time reviewing the literature on the subject, but couldn’t find anything conclusive. Rather than do a point-by-point summary of each study (<a href="https://danluu.com/empirical-pl/" target="_blank" rel="external">like I did here for here for another controversial topic</a>), I’ll mention the high-level issues that make the studies irrelevant to me. All studies I could find had at least one of the issues listed below; if you have a link to a study that isn’t irrelevant for one of the following reasons, I’d love to hear about it!</p>
<ol>
<li>Age of study: it’s unclear how a study on interacting with computers from the mid-80s transfers to how people interact with computers today. Even ignoring differences in editing programs, there are large differences in the interface. Mice are more precise and a decent modern optical mouse can be moved as fast as a human can move it without the tracking becoming erratic, something that isn’t true of any mouse I’ve tried from the 80s and was only true of high quality mice from the 90s when the balls were recently cleaned and the mouse was on a decent quality mousepad. Keyboards haven’t improved as much, but even so, I can type substantially faster a modern, low-travel, keyboard than on any keyboard I’ve tried from the 80s.</li>
<li>Narrow microbenchmarking: not all of these are as irrelevant as the<br><code>e -</code><br><code>&gt;</code><br><code>|</code><br>without search and replace task, but even in the case of tasks that aren’t obviously irrelevant, it’s not clear what the impact of the result is on actual work I might do.</li>
<li>Not keyboard vs. mouse: a tiny fraction of published studies are on keyboard vs. mouse interaction. When a study is on device interaction, it’s often about some new kind of device or a new interaction model.</li>
<li>Vague description: a lot of studies will say something like they found a 7.8% improvement, with results being significant with p<br>&lt;<br> 0.005, without providing enough information to tell if the results are actually significant or merely statistically significant (recall that the practically insignificant scrolling result was a 0.08s difference, which could also be reported as a 16.3% improvement).</li>
<li>Unskilled users: in one, typical, paper, they note that it can take users as long as two seconds to move the mouse from one side of the screen to a scrollbar on the other side of the screen. While there’s something to be said for doing studies on unskilled users in order to figure out what sorts of interfaces are easiest for users who have the hardest time, a study on users who take 2 seconds to get their mouse onto the scrollbar doesn’t appear to be relevant to my user experience. When I timed this for myself, it took 0.21s to get to the scrollbar from the other side of the screen and scroll a short distance, despite using an unfamiliar mouse with different sensitivity than I’m used to and running a recording program which made mousing more difficult than usual.</li>
<li>Seemingly unreasonable results: some studies claim to show large improvements in overall productivity when switching from type of device to another (e.g., a 20% total productivity gain from switching types of mice).</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>It’s entirely possible that the mysterious studies Tog’s org spent $50M on prove that the mouse is faster than the keyboard for all tasks other than raw text input, but there doesn’t appear to be enough information to tell what the actual studies were. There are many public studies on user input, but I couldn’t find any that are relevant to whether or not I should use the mouse more or less at the margin.</p>
<p>When I look at various tasks myself, the results are mixed, and they’re mixed in the way that most programmers I polled predicted. This result is so boring that it wouldn’t be worth mentioning if not for the large groups of people who believe that either the keyboard is always faster than the mouse or vice versa.</p>
<p>Please let me know if there are relevant studies on this topic that I should read! I’m not familiar with the relevant fields, so it’s possible that I’m searching with the wrong keywords and reading the wrong papers.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With conversion on mobile much lower then desktop, improving it is a priority for retailers.</p>
<p>How does your mobile conversion measure up?</p>
<h3 id="How-does-your-mobile-conversion-rate-stack-up-against-the-Mobile-Benchmark"><a href="#How-does-your-mobile-conversion-rate-stack-up-against-the-Mobile-Benchmark" class="headerlink" title="How does your mobile conversion rate stack up against the Mobile Benchmark?"></a>How does your mobile conversion rate stack up against the Mobile Benchmark?</h3><p>Finding out how your mobile conversion rates compare with the market average, and with a range of retailers, is the first step towards focused optimisation.</p>
<p>It’s no secret that conversion rates amongst customers using mobile devices is a real issue for retailers. The fact that mobile delivers roughly half the conversion rate of desktop is worry enough - but add shoppers’ growing preference for the mobile channel and it’s little wonder so many retailers now see mobile optimisation as a priority.</p>
<p>But where to start? That’s been the first question for almost all the retailers with whom we’ve worked on mobile optimisation over the last few months. They’ve known it’s a problem, but not how big a problem or where to begin tackling it.</p>
<h3 id="The-Mobile-Benchmark"><a href="#The-Mobile-Benchmark" class="headerlink" title="The Mobile Benchmark"></a>The Mobile Benchmark</h3><p>The first step has to be to understand the scale of the problem - to look at mobile conversion not in isolation, but in the kind of meaningful context that provides an answer the question:<em>“How big a problem is mobile conversion for this retailer?”</em></p>
<p>The work we’ve done in this area at Biglight has generated a huge amount of data around customer behaviour on mobile - and, as a result, we can benchmark performance in aggregate and in micro-conversions from arrival on the site through to checkout.</p>
<p>In this post, I want to look at the top level - the aggregate view. We call it the Mobile Benchmark. It’s a simple, quadrant-style graph that visualises mobile performance, when compared with other retailers and an overall average.</p>
<p>It looks like this (below), the two gold lines marking the average positions on each axis - 50% for the mobile traffic mix, and just over 45% for mobile conversion rate, as a percentage of desktop conversion rate:</p>
<p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/32EviqE.png!web" alt=""></p>
<p>This is real data, based on the UK performance of 15 leading retailers of apparel, footwear, homewares and accessories in March and April this year, but the method can be applied to almost any type of retailer. Just follow this simple formula and then plot the results on the same X and Y axes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Work out the Mobile Traffic Mix % (the X axis) - Mobile (smartphone) traffic divided by total traffic, multiplied by 100</li>
<li>Then work out the Relative Conversion Rate % for mobile (the Y axis) - Mobile Conversion % divided by Desktop Conversion %, multiplied by 100.</li>
</ol>
<p>By looking at relative conversion performance, we eliminate the variation in conversion between retailers for other reasons (such as overall proposition, availability etc), allowing us to focus on the performance of mobile in a relatively comparable context.</p>
<h3 id="Using-the-Mobile-Benchmark-How-big-is-the-opportunity"><a href="#Using-the-Mobile-Benchmark-How-big-is-the-opportunity" class="headerlink" title="Using the Mobile Benchmark: How big is the opportunity?"></a>Using the Mobile Benchmark: How big is the opportunity?</h3><p>In essence, this instantly highlights how big any retailer’s mobile optimisation opportunity is, and how urgently the process should begin.</p>
<p>For instance, a retailer that plots in the top left quadrant is in a relatively strong position - that position denotes a relatively low mobile mix, and a relatively high mobile conversion rate. That means, mobile users are a lower proportion of traffic than average and that those who visit the site using mobile deliver a better than average conversion rate, relative to desktop.</p>
<p>On the other hand, those that plot in the bottom right quadrant have a serious, and urgent problem (or the biggest potential opportunity). The combination of a high mobile mix with a low relative mobile conversion rate is not good news - lots of people are visiting by mobile, but they are not simply not converting.</p>
<p>Of course, those are the extremes. As the example above demonstrates though, most plot somewhere between the two, which shows that, for the vast majority of retailers, there remains a significant opportunity to improve mobile revenue performance.</p>
<p>We’ve noted over time that all data points tend to shift to the right (as mobile continues to displace both desktop and tablet as the users’ device of choice), but there is no evidence of any increase in relative conversion performance as this happens. In short, there is no correlation between an increase in the Mobile Traffic Mix and Relative Conversion Rate over time.</p>
<p>Where the Mobile Benchmark has proven most useful for our clients is in offering visual, empirical evidence of the issue, benchmarked against the market - the ability to share that across the business has proven very handy when scaling the opportunity (relative to both the average and maximum performance) and securing budget to get the mobile optimisation process going.</p>
<h3 id="Focused-mobile-optimisation-What-next"><a href="#Focused-mobile-optimisation-What-next" class="headerlink" title="Focused mobile optimisation: What next?"></a>Focused mobile optimisation: What next?</h3><p>The next step is to understand precisely where the issues are - which aspects of the mobile journey are simply not working and why.</p>
<p>That, again, starts with a benchmarking process; one that breaks the journey down into stages. We look at ‘Browse to Basket’ and ‘Basket to Conversion’ as two broad steps in the journey - then in more detail at micro-conversions (for instance the product detail page to product listing page micro-conversion), to identify the specific parts of the journey that present the biggest optimisation opportunities.</p>
<p>We then complete structured usability testing, focusing on those parts of the journey, along with other behavioural research, to identify the_why_behind the opportunities the data has revealed. That discipline, along with prototyping major changes, A/B testing and rapid deployment, are the final steps towards delivering a step-change in mobile revenue performance.</p>
<p>I’ll cover those steps in the process in more detail in my next post. In the meantime, why not take the challenge?</p>
<p>Plot your own mobile performance on the Mobile Benchmark and let us know how you get on.</p>

You can’t really symbolize them, and if you do, changing their color requires some text symbol trickery.<strong>Developing</strong>with icon fonts is simple, but not without issues. If the browser fails to load the icon font, then you’re up shit creek without a paddle. And you’re alone. In a kayak.<em>Sad.</em></p>
<p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/V7nami.png!web" alt=""></p>
<p>Well…now what?</p>
<h4 id="So…use-SVGs-then"><a href="#So…use-SVGs-then" class="headerlink" title="So…use SVGs then?"></a>So…use SVGs then?</h4><p>Well for<strong>designers</strong>, SVGs are certainly easier to symbolize in Sketch, but it can be kind of a pain to change their color._So just don’t make them symbols, right? Then you can use layer styles to make them different colors!_But what if you want to update the little dropdown arrow from a caret to a triangle? Well good luck finding all 398 occurrences of that little arrow and updating them one-by-one. So that’s…well,<em>not great</em>. And I know from experience that<strong>developers</strong>love nothing more than using standalone SVGs for each and every icon in my design. Don’t worry guys, there are only 207 unique icons. That shouldn’t affect page load. I promise. /s</p>
<h4 id="Ugh-then-what"><a href="#Ugh-then-what" class="headerlink" title="Ugh, then what?!"></a>Ugh, then what?!</h4><p>Keep reading, knucklehead �� And before we dive in, here’s something free. This will help you follow along with the rest of the tutorial.</p>
<h3 id="My-Workflow"><a href="#My-Workflow" class="headerlink" title="My Workflow"></a>My Workflow</h3><p>My approach is divided into two parts:<strong>What I Do for Design</strong>and<strong>What I Do for Development</strong>. Neither technique is completely perfect, but it’s been successful so far, and makes the most people happy along the way.</p>
<p>That’s important!</p>
<h3 id="What-I-Do-For-Designers"><a href="#What-I-Do-For-Designers" class="headerlink" title="What I Do For Designers"></a>What I Do For Designers</h3><p>I<strong>absolutely love</strong>the Nucleo icon set. There are 8,300+ icons available in all kinds of different styles (outlined, solid, mini, full color, two-toned), and they’ve even included those pesky social icons that you need on pretty much every project. You can grab those below ($49 for a year, $129 for life).</p>

<p>The absolute fastest and most sustainable way to use icons in Sketch is by using<strong>color symbols and masks</strong>. You’ve seen this technique before thanks to my palFrancesco, but here’s a quick refresher:</p>
<p><a href="https://freeandwilling.com/fbmore?go=Sketch-Tint-Icons-Using-Nested-Symbols-UX-PowerTools" target="_blank" rel="external">Sketch: Tint icons using nested symbols - Design&amp;Prototype - Medium_I always wanted to create a single version of an icon and apply different colors to, or tint it, to indicate its state…_freeandwilling.com</a></p>
<p>Step 1:Make symbols for the fill colors you want to use for your icons. Make sure every color symbol artboard is the same size.</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/yMfyi2v.png!web" alt=""></p>
<p>Step 2:Make a new artboard for your icon symbol. Paste your icon onto your new artboard. If you’re using the<a href="https://freeandwilling.com/Jon?go=icon-article-nucleo" target="_blank" rel="external">Nucleo Icon</a>desktop app, just drag the icon directly into Sketch, then put it on your new artboard.</p>
<p><img src="http://img1.tuicool.com/rYzeMjy.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Step 3:Make sure your icon is a single shape, and set it as a mask. If your icon isn’t a single shape, then select the different paths and union them.</p>
<p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/AbmUZ3f.png!web" alt=""></p>
<p>Step 4:Insert any of the color symbols on top of your icon mask and resize it to the size of your artboard. You’ll be able to override this color whenever you add an instance of your icon!</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/qERrQzN.png!web" alt=""></p>
<p>Step 5 (Optional):If your icon is a logo (see above), set the mask fill to the brand color of the app. It’s easy to quickly find official brand colors over on<a href="https://brandcolors.net/" target="_blank" rel="external">brandcolors.net</a>. This saves you from having to create color symbols for a bunch of different app colors — if you ever want to use the brand color, just turn OFF the color symbol override:</p>
<p><img src="http://img1.tuicool.com/mEf22ai.gif" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong></p>
<p>If you have color symbols with semi-transparent fills, you’ll be able to see the mask fill through the transparency. So if you want 25% black to be an available color, don’t use a fill on the mask.</p>
<h4 id="Why-This-Works-for-Designers"><a href="#Why-This-Works-for-Designers" class="headerlink" title="Why This Works for Designers"></a>Why This Works for Designers</h4><ul>
<li>All of my icons are symbols, so if I ever want to update them, I can do it in one place and immediately see it update across all of my designs.</li>
<li>I can quickly override the color from the inspector.</li>
<li>If I update a color symbol, it will update all icons that use that color.</li>
<li>I can nest icons inside of other symbols and quickly swap them out.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Why-This-Doesn’t-Work-for-Developers"><a href="#Why-This-Doesn’t-Work-for-Developers" class="headerlink" title="Why This Doesn’t Work for Developers"></a>Why This Doesn’t Work for Developers</h4><ul>
<li>Zeplin and InVision don’t read color overrides, so they’ll only ever show you the color you used in the base symbol.</li>
<li>The color symbol + mask technique adds some bloat to the SVG file size.</li>
<li>They’re all individual SVGs, so devs will want to jump off a bridge.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Side note:</strong>All of the icons in<a href="https://www.uxpower.tools/" target="_blank" rel="external">UX Power Tools</a>are constructed this way. It’s super fast to swap colors, and even easier to swap icons inside of elements like buttons, fields, and notifications.</p>
<h3 id="What-I-Do-For-Developers"><a href="#What-I-Do-For-Developers" class="headerlink" title="What I Do For Developers"></a>What I Do For Developers</h3><p>Zeplin works incredibly well for layout, color, and typography, but isn’t terribly efficient for assets. Instead of having devs pull icons directly from Zeplin (or sending them a zip of SVGs), I use<a href="https://freeandwilling.com/Jon?go=icon-article-nucleo" target="_blank" rel="external">Nucleo</a>to build an SVG sprite, then send that to developers. Not to brag, but they :heart: me for it :relieved:</p>
<p>Step 1:Create a new project in the Nucleo web app.</p>
<p>Step 2:Add icons to your Nucleo project that you intend to use (or have already used) in your designs.</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/qEN7bi7.png!web" alt=""></p>
<p>Step 3:Open the project, select all icons in the right panel, and click<em>Download</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/vUFFRvY.png!web" alt=""></p>
<p>Step 4:Choose your export preferences. “Export as Symbol” uses_xlink:href<em>which will be<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/xlink:href" target="_blank" rel="external">deprecated in SVG 2</a>(not out yet). That being said, it’s just the</em>“xlink”_portion that will no longer be needed, so “Export as Symbol” is still a safe option. I usually choose “Export CSS”, which creates a single SVG sprite, then creates a CSS file with classes for each icon.</p>
<p>But wait, that’s not even the best part!</p>
<p>Along with the SVG sprite and generated CSS, Nucleo also creates an HTML page showing off each icon, and the CSS class for using that icon in code.</p>
<p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/qUFNB3E.png!web" alt=""></p>

<li>You don’t have to change your design process</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h3><p>There are fast ways to_<strong>design</strong><em>with icons, and fast ways to</em><strong>develop</strong>_with them. It’s a little extra work to make things optimal for both parties, but it will make everyone’s lives easier.</p>
<p>If you’re not using<a href="https://freeandwilling.com/Jon?go=icon-article-nucleo" target="_blank" rel="external">Nucleo</a>, you can find lots of services like<a href="https://iconizr.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Iconizr</a>that will help you generate an SVG sprite. If you’re lucky enough to have your own icon designer(s), then you’ll have to do this anyway since everything will be custom! You lucky dog.</p>
<p>Check out<a href="https://www.uxpower.tools/" target="_blank" rel="external"><strong>UX Power Tools</strong></a>to see how you can use these icons in all kinds of sophisticated nested symbols. It’s truly the fastest way to design.</p>

    <updated>2017-06-13T09:37:14.046Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In January 2011 I was on summer break, but instead of getting a day job, or socializing, I spent a lot of time holed up in my room writing the first version of an iOS app called<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/class-timetable/id425121147?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="external">Class Timetable</a>. The year before, I’d been looking for a simple, easy to use timetable app, and nothing on the App Store quite fit the bill - everything was too complicated and hard to use. The idea was to create a no fuss, straight forward solution, something that was easier and more convenient than a paper timetable/schedule. Over a few months, I spent about 500 hours designing and coding it. Fast forward to today, and the app has had more than three million downloads, a lot of positive App Store ratings, and at times has been my primary source of income. Haven’t heard of the app? Yeah, it hasn’t taken off yet in the US, but is reasonably popular in Aus/NZ/UK, at least among college and school students.</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/32Evqin.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>I’ve read a bunch of blogs recently about people that hit the jackpot, got their app featured, and were looking at figures like 100,000 downloads a day. In comparison, I’ve only been moderately successful. Class Timetable has never made the App Store #1 position, I didn’t become rich overnight, and I’ve failed more times than I’ve succeeded. I’ve invested a lot of time, probably thousands of hours all up, unlike some hit apps that were created in a weekend. Sure, three million downloads is a lot, but that’s happened over more than six years.</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/mMvUFrR.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>Instead, my ‘moderate success’ story is closer to one of hard work, and slow, steady progress. It’s probably more true to real life than other success stories, because let’s face it: not everyone is going to wind up creating the next Flappy Bird. Instead of being a viral hit, Class Timetable has been doing moderately well for more than six years, which is a little special in itself - many #1 apps can’t claim a lifespan that long. I’d like to share a few things I’ve learned over the last few years, so hopefully there’s something here you’ll find useful, no matter how much success you have, or haven’t (yet) seen.</p>

There was one called ‘Ginge-O-Meter’ that I put a lot of work into. The concept: take a photo of someone, and find out how ginger their hair is. It used real image recognition and color analysis techniques to deliver an answer, and it actually worked (most of the time). Unfortunately, the idea didn’t catch… I think I made about $50. It was my big shot, and to be quite honest I was pretty dismayed at how much work I put in to see it fail. But I didn’t stop there, and Class Timetable went on to become what it is today. Anyway, my point here is not to hedge your bets.If your winning idea doesn’t succeed: get up and try again, and again… and again, because for all you know your next idea could be the one that makes it.</p>
<h3 id="Design-everything-around-the-first-time-user"><a href="#Design-everything-around-the-first-time-user" class="headerlink" title="Design everything around the first time user."></a>Design everything around the first time user.</h3><p>Imagine getting an email in all caps, telling you that you that your app is stuck ‘installing’ and that you need to fix it… pretty frustrating, right? After a few emails like this, you realize that you can never make your product simple enough to use. What I’ve learned (aside from sucking it up, and sending a kind, helpful response) is: design your product as if it was going to be used by people that are a software literacy step below the target user. Keep it simple, make it idiot proof - design everything around the first time user experience. Make sure there’s nowhere people can get tripped up, and that every task has a straight forward, simple workflow. Less time will be spent on support, people will be happier in general with your product, and your ratings will go up. When Class Timetable first started getting thousands of downloads a day, I’d average around twenty emails a week. I’m sure there were other users with the same issues that couldn’t be bothered sending an email, and instead would simply stop using the app. By refining the product areas that led to these emails, I’m now down to an email every two or three days - and most of these are things that aren’t real issues, like feature suggestions, or the occasional fan email (really).</p>

Now, if I implemented all of those features, the app would be a confusing mess, with 17 background choices, 72 different things vying for your attention on screen, and a settings option for just about everything. Heck, even if I just implemented every sensible idea, the result wouldn’t be too much different. The problem is that even when users can see a genuine product issue, they can’t always see the best solution. So what can we do instead? Listen to your users -<em>to their real, underlying problems</em>- and solve them in a way that takes the product as a whole forward. Sometimes, a great feature suggestion might have downsides for the product as a whole, which means letting it go. This would often happen with Class Timetable: one of its primary features is simplicity and ease of use. While many features have been added to it over the years, a lot of feature suggestions would have made the product as a whole more complicated. Sometimes that was OK, but more often than not I opted for simplicity, the feature that kept it unique.</p>
<h3 id="A-great-product-is-better-than-a-viral-gimmick"><a href="#A-great-product-is-better-than-a-viral-gimmick" class="headerlink" title="A great product is better than a viral gimmick."></a>A great product is better than a viral gimmick.</h3><p>Class Timetable has never made the App Store front page, or had 100,000 downloads in a day - but that doesn’t matter to me. Some apps reach the #1 spot on the charts, only to become wastelands not even a year later. Perhaps they had a funny quip, viral marketing strategy, or just got lucky - but ultimately, they didn’t have any substance, and they didn’t solve a real world problem in a useful way. By making a genuinely great product, you’re designing something that your users keep coming back to again and again. Put in effort where people might not even notice. Focus on solving real problems, and making a product that is so genuinely useful that your users are coming back and bringing others with them.Returning users is a great sign that your product is healthy.As a bonus, there’s a small viral effect that every active user has, and it’s always great to know that your next customer isn’t just replacing someone that left.</p>
<h3 id="Be-generous"><a href="#Be-generous" class="headerlink" title="Be generous."></a>Be generous.</h3><p>When Class Timetable first went on the App Store, it was a paid $1 download. I figured that for the amount of effort I had put in (~500 hours), $1 was a steal. Anyway, in the first week, 4 people bought the app, and the next week, even less than that. Not sure what it feels like to hit the jackpot, but this didn’t quite feel like it. 500 hours is a lot of time to throw down the drain! I could have left it to die a slow death earning $1 a week, but instead I decided to make the app free. I’d created it to solve a real problem, and I figured that others would find it genuinely useful. Almost straight away, downloads started to pick up. 50 downloads a day, then 100, 1000… wow. Had I held onto the amount of hours I put in and not been generous, I very much doubt that downloads would ever have picked up. Soon after, I added an in app purchase enabling extra features, which now has quite a reasonable uptake. Much higher than a few dollars a week anyway. So, don’t be stingy: a product with no paying users is (usually) better than a paid product with no users.It’s much easier to upsell to an existing customer than it is to find an entirely new paying customer.</p>
<h3 id="Take-a-step-back-often"><a href="#Take-a-step-back-often" class="headerlink" title="Take a step back, often."></a>Take a step back, often.</h3><p>Sometimes you’re stuck on a problem, and there just don’t seem to be any great solutions: maybe it’s related to a piece of code you’re writing, or decisions around how you’re going to market your app. Then, you start thinking about the problem from a wider perspective. You realize that you won’t need to even write the tricky piece of code if you architect it the right way, and that the marketing decision is one your friend (who has a knack for that sort of problem) would know how to tackle. You could sum it up as ‘taking a step back’ from the problem. In my entire software career, there’s not a second I’ve spent doing this that I’ve regretted. There’s been plenty of times, especially early on, that I wish I did this and never did. I learned the hard way with Class Timetable: with version 1.0, I spent a lot of time just ‘getting stuck in’ and coding it. I solved tricky problems by cutting corners and ‘making it happen’, instead of taking a step back. As long as users never knew, it was fine right? A year or two later, I had to rewrite the entire codebase from scratch - for so many reasons - which was a massive undertaking. Take a step back! It’s worth it.</p>
<p>Today, Class Timetable continues to do well. I’m always looking to the future, whether that means the next iOS upgrade, or a bigger picture of what Class Timetable could evolve into. If you’re studying at school or college, feel free to<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/class-timetable/id425121147?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="external">give it a go</a>- I hope you find it genuinely useful.</p>
