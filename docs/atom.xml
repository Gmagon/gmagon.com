<p>Travis Kalanick.</p>
<p>Travis Kalanick stepped down Tuesday as chief executive of Uber, the ride-hailing service that he helped found in 2009 and that he built into a transportation colossus, after a shareholder revolt made it untenable for him to stay on at the company.</p>
<p>Mr. Kalanick’s exit came under pressure after hours of drama involving Uber’s investors, according to two people with knowledge of the situation, who asked to remain anonymous because the details are confidential.</p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday, five of Uber’s major investors demanded that the chief executive resign immediately. The investors included one of Uber’s biggest shareholders, the venture capital firm Benchmark, which has one of its partners, Bill Gurley, on Uber’s board. The investors made their demand for Mr. Kalanick to resign in a letter delivered to the chief executive while he was in Chicago, said the people with knowledge of the situation.</p>
<p>More from the New York Times:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/12/technology/uber-chief-travis-kalanick-stock-buyback.html" target="_blank" rel="external">How Uber’s chief is gaining even more clout in the company</a></p>
<p>In the letter, titled “Moving Uber Forward” and obtained by The New York Times, the investors wrote to Mr. Kalanick that he must immediately leave and that the company needed a change in leadership. Mr. Kalanick, 40, consulted with at least one Uber board member and after hours of discussions with some of the investors, he agreed to step down. He will remain on Uber’s board of directors.</p>
<p>“I love Uber more than anything in the world and at this difficult moment in my personal life I have accepted the investors request to step aside so that Uber can go back to building rather than be distracted with another fight,” Mr. Kalanick said in a statement.</p>
<p>The move caps months of questions over the leadership of Uber, which has become a prime example of Silicon Valley start-up culture gone awry. The company has been exposed this year as having a workplace culture that is rife with sexual harassment and discrimination, and has pushed the envelope in dealing with law enforcement and even partners. That tone was set by Mr. Kalanick, who has aggressively turned the company into the world’s dominant ride-hailing service and upended the transportation industry around the globe.</p>
<p>Mr. Kalanick’s troubles began earlier this year after a former Uber engineer detailed what she said was sexual harassment at the company, opening the floodgates for more complaints and spurring internal investigations. In addition, Uber has been dealing with an intellectual property lawsuit from Waymo, the self-driving car business that operates under Google’s parent company, and a federal inquiry into a software tool that Uber used to sidestep some law enforcement.</p>
<p>Uber has been trying to move past its difficult history, which has grown inextricably tied to Mr. Kalanick. In recent months, Uber has fired more than 20 employees after an investigation into the company’s culture, embarked on major changes to professionalize its workplace, and is searching for new executives including a chief operating officer.</p>
<p>Mr. Kalanick last week said he would take an indefinite leave of absence from Uber, partly to work on himself and to grieve for his mother, who died last month in a boating accident. He said Uber’s day-to-day management would fall to a committee of more than 10 executives.</p>
<p>But the shareholder letter indicates that his taking time off was not enough for some investors who have pumped millions of dollars into the ride-hailing company, which has seen its valuation swell to nearly $70 billion. For them, Mr. Kalanick had to go.</p>
<p>The five shareholders who demanded Mr. Kalanick’s resignation include some of the technology industry’s most prestigious venture capital firms, which invested in Uber at an early stage of the company’s life, as well as a mutual fund firm. Apart from Benchmark, they are First Round Capital, Lowercase Capital, Menlo Ventures and Fidelity Investments, which together own more than a quarter of Uber’s stock. Because some of the investors hold a type of stock that endows them with an outsize number of votes, they have about 40 percent of Uber’s voting power.</p>
<p>Mr. Kalanick’s resignation opens questions of who may take over Uber, especially since the company has been so molded in his image. And Mr. Kalanick will probably remain a presence there since he still retains control of a majority of Uber’s voting shares.</p>
<p>Taking a start-up chief executive to task so publicly is relatively unusual in Silicon Valley, where investors often praise entrepreneurs and their aggressiveness, especially if their companies are growing fast. It is only when those start-ups are in a precarious position or are declining that shareholders move to protect their investment.</p>
<p>In the case of Uber — one of the most highly valued private companies in the world — investors could lose billions of dollars if the company were to be marked down in valuation.</p>
<p>Uber, which has raised more than $11 billion from investors since its founding in 2009, has a wide base of shareholders apart from the ones who signed the letter. Uber’s investors also include TPG Capital, the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, mutual fund giants like BlackRock and wealthy clients of firms like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>In the letter, in addition to Mr. Kalanick’s immediate resignation, the five shareholders asked for improved oversight of the company’s board by filling two of three empty board seats with “truly independent directors.” They also demanded that Mr. Kalanick support a board-led search committee for a new chief executive, and that Uber immediately hire an experienced chief financial officer.</p>

<p>NCAR</p>
<p>IBM’s supercomputers might soon power the weather-predicting systems of tomorrow. Through its subsidiary The Weather Company, the computing titan has partnered with the University Corporation for Academic Research (UCAR) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) to move beyond today’s regional-scale forecasting to anticipate weather at the local level…and aspire to introduce the first model that covers the whole globe.</p>
<p>Current tech forecasts massively-sized meteorological systems that influence regional weather, like snowstorms and hurricanes. The model this IBM collaboration wants to build would account for the influence smaller events (like thunderstorms) have on local weather. IBM will join with UCAR to co-design a computational solution that runs on the former’s POWER9-based systems, which are set to launch at the end of the year. The Weather Company will use this computing powerhouse to adapt NCAR’s community-weather model to a global scale and refine the longer-term predictions to make more accurate forecasts weeks or months out.</p>

<p>For the longest time, Apple product leaks tended to come from the<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/04/24/apple-iphone-8-may-not-ship-in-september/" target="_blank" rel="external">supply chain</a>: a factory worker would<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011/01/05/iphone-5-parts-caught-on-video/" target="_blank" rel="external">send parts</a>or<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/05/15/exclusive-iphone-8-renders/" target="_blank" rel="external">a design file</a>to accessory makers eager to get a head start on their next iPhone cases. You might want to rethink that assumption. In a leaked secrecy briefing (ironic, we know) obtained by<em>The Outline</em>, Apple’s David Rice<a href="https://theoutline.com/post/1766/leaked-recording-inside-apple-s-global-war-on-leakers" target="_blank" rel="external">revealed</a>that leaks from the company’s campuses were more common in 2016 than those from suppliers. This is more a reflection of Apple’s success clamping down on third-party leaks than loose lips in Cupertino, although it does indicate that the tech giant will turn its attention inward.</p>
<p>Rice doesn’t divulge too many of Apple’s methods for countering supply chain leaks, but he notes that Apple will buy back parts to make sure they don’t reach the news: in 2013, it snapped up 19,000<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013/09/17/iphone-5c-review/" target="_blank" rel="external">iPhone 5c</a>shells before the announcement. It also screens 221 million transits (that is, people leaving or entering factories) per year, so it’s less likely that someone will walk out with an iPhone enclosure. The reduction in leaks is no mean feat given those daunting figures, especially since workers are sometimes offered juicy incentives (up to a year’s worth of salary) to smuggle parts.</p>
<p>The presentation also underscores the drastic efforts Apple takes to lock things down at home. They’re not completely draconian, but they’re bound to raise questions. Many of Apple’s anti-leak investigators, including Rice himself, come from agencies like the NSA, FBI and Secret Service – does it really need to treat an iPad leak like a matter of national security? The company will also pursue in-house leakers for<em>years</em>, and is adamant that employees avoid discussing products with family or in the more public parts of Apple’s offices. It’ll sometimes place overseers on product teams to actively prevent leaks.</p>
<p>Rice is quick to note that Apple isn’t reading emails or eavesdropping on conversations, but there’s still a sense that Apple is watching closely. Some incoming employees will delete social accounts, or take those accounts private, out of a concern that they might accidentally say too much.</p>
<p>Apple does have strong financial incentives to cut back on leaks, as they can hurt sales or reveal its product strategy to competitors. In a call discussing Apple’s<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/05/02/apple-q2-2017-earnings/" target="_blank" rel="external">spring earnings</a>, Tim Cook blamed an iPhone sales slide on unusually early and frequent leaks for the next model. However, the briefing makes it clear that Apple takes its secrecy more seriously than many other companies, and possibly too seriously. Is it really a matter of life and death that a new iPhone remains under wraps, especially since Apple’s launch schedules are fairly predictable? Apple built its modern reputation on “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/05/01/apple-siri-speaker-said-due-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="external">one more thing</a>“ surprises, but it’s not clear that spoilers are as damaging as the company thinks.</p>

<p>Bloomberg via Getty Images</p>
<p>Apple and IKEA are creating an AR app that will let customers preview how an item will look in their home. Michael Valdsgaard, IKEA’s digital transformation manager, told Swedish website<a href="http://digital.di.se/artikel/ikea-om-samarbetet-med-apple-superintressant-for-oss" target="_blank" rel="external"><em>Digital.di</em></a>, “This will be the first augmented reality app that allows you to make reliable buying decisions.”</p>
<p>In the first version, customers will take photos of their homes and use the app to place<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016/04/05/ikea-htc-vive-kitchen-vr-app/" target="_blank" rel="external">images</a>of IKEA products wherever they might want them. Valdsgaard said users will be able to position products with millimeter precision and sizing of the products will be to scale. Eventually, customers may be able to try out products and then order them through the app.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/06/08/ikea-mars-simulator-teenage-engineering/" target="_blank" rel="external">IKEA</a>catalog app sort of lets you do this now, but not with much accuracy. In it, you can click on a piece of furniture and see it superimposed over whatever your camera is pointed towards. You can drag the furniture around and get an idea of what it might look like in your home and you can even use the app to make sure the size is accurate. But Valdsgaard says the new app will be better with the help of<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014/09/07/ikea-apple-ad-parody/" target="_blank" rel="external">Apple’s</a>technology and experience with AR.</p>
<p>IKEA isn’t the only retail company with AR shopping experiences. Both<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016/06/09/lowes-tango-ar-app/" target="_blank" rel="external">Lowe’s</a>and<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/20/pottery-barn-ar-app/" target="_blank" rel="external">Pottery Barn</a>have apps that let you get an idea of how furniture and appliances will look in your home. Lowe’s even uses AR to help customers navigate their stores and<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/14/lowe-s-is-using-ar-and-vr-to-make-how-to-easier/" target="_blank" rel="external">VR</a>to give lessons on how to successfully complete certain home improvement projects.</p>
<p>Valdsgaard says they would like to have the app available by the iOS 11 debut, but that it may not be possible. IKEA expects to have 500-600 products available on the app at launch.</p>

    <title>The 4 Fundamental Pillars Of A Successful Company (According To These 4 CEOs)</title>

    <updated>2017-06-21T08:45:40.924Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to building asuccessful company, there truly is a “method to the madness.” Read enough interviews, listen to enough<a href="https://www.inc.com/nicolas-cole/this-ceo-says-its-time-to-rethink-your-approach-to-video-marketing.html" target="_blank" rel="external">CEOs speak on their difficult journey</a>up the mountain, and you’ll start to draw parallels from one experience to another – regardless of industry.</p>
<p>One of the ways I feed<a href="https://www.inc.com/nicolas-cole/the-4-biggest-obstacles-all-new-entrepreneurs-face-and-how-these-4-young-entrepr.html" target="_blank" rel="external">my own learning process as a young entrepreneur</a>is by learning from those above or ahead of me on the path. I am constantly looking for new people to learn from, eager to hear what solutions they found for themselves (and selfishly, how I might avoid those same challenges in the future).</p>
<p>But “success” isn’t just about achievement. In fact, the most successful companies don’t just measure the end result, the total revenue, but the process that got them that result. Efficiency and good habits are equally (if not more) important.</p>
<p>So, what do some of those good habits look like?</p>
<h2 id="Pillar-Number-1-“Cash-is-King”"><a href="#Pillar-Number-1-“Cash-is-King”" class="headerlink" title="Pillar Number 1: “Cash is King”"></a>Pillar Number 1: “Cash is King”</h2><p>A difficult concept made simple, “Cash is King” is the mantra every business (and business leader) should live by.</p>
<p>“You can’t run a business on the promise of cash or future payment. It is the only metric that really matters and should be the primary measure of your company’s success at every stage,” said Aaron Webber, CEO of<a href="http://madisonwall.co/#home" target="_blank" rel="external">MadisonWall</a>, a venture capital firm and holding company to a handful of creative agencies. “A million dollars in outstanding invoices looks great and all, but it won’t help you if you can’t pay next week’s rent. You need to have physical cash in the bank set aside for when those inevitable obstacles arise.”</p>
<p>He went on to explain that a successful company is one that practices fiscal prudence and understands the power of compounding interest and investing back into the business. If you can develop and maintain good spending habits with this in mind, you won’t just sustain your business, you will grow it. And if not, then your business has little chance of survival. Unfortunately, money won’t fix bad habits. In fact, it might make them worse.</p>
<h2 id="Pillar-Number-2-Leadership-that-isn’t-ego-driven"><a href="#Pillar-Number-2-Leadership-that-isn’t-ego-driven" class="headerlink" title="Pillar Number 2: Leadership that isn’t ego driven."></a>Pillar Number 2: Leadership that isn’t ego driven.</h2><p>Too often, I see young entrepreneurs get overly excited about what they’re going to call themselves, and who gets to put the title of “CEO” in their Twitter bio–now that they’ve made a website and decided on a name for their “company.”</p>
<p>I know I’m not the first person to say this, and I know I won’t be the last. But it is an interesting thing to observe in my peers, and those who are ambitious about starting big companies. I see them spending more time on what title they want to wear, rather than how they’re going to actually build something of value.</p>
<p>“If you truly want to build a loyal team, you have to realize that it’s not all about you. Especially as the CEO, your job isn’t to be the center of attention. Your job is to make everyone else’s lives easier, and give them the opportunity to do great work. You’re the facilitator, the coach, not necessarily the star player,” said<a href="http://themfceo.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Andy Frisella</a>, CEO of 1st Phorm International.</p>
<h2 id="Pillar-Number-3-Productivity-can’t-be-chained-to-a-cubicle"><a href="#Pillar-Number-3-Productivity-can’t-be-chained-to-a-cubicle" class="headerlink" title="Pillar Number 3: Productivity can’t be chained to a cubicle."></a>Pillar Number 3: Productivity can’t be chained to a cubicle.</h2><p>This is a hot topic for the companies of today, this idea of open work environments and allowing for more employee freedom.</p>
<p>Jim Kwik, founder and CEO of<a href="https://kwiklearning.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Kwik Learning</a>, has served as the mental coach to some of the world’s leading CEOs and celebrities. On the topic of productivity and brain fitness in the workplace, he said, “We are becoming more and more aware that working 8 straight hours, 5 days a week, might not be the most productive method for maximum efficiency. In fact, many companies are starting to realize that by being more flexible, and allowing their employees more freedom, they will actually produce better work. It just might not happen within the hours of 9-5. And you know what? That’s OK.”</p>
<p>Especially for new leaders and founders, it can be easy to fall into the trap of thinking that hours-in is the best measure for productivity or success. But the truth is, it’s not. In fact, a lot of today’s business leaders are operating more under the belief that hours-in is a poor metric, and the only thing that matters is the final product. If you do it in half the time while working from home, great. Just get it done, and get it done well.</p>
<h2 id="Pillar-Number-4-Your-customer-service-can’t-suck"><a href="#Pillar-Number-4-Your-customer-service-can’t-suck" class="headerlink" title="Pillar Number 4: Your customer service can’t suck."></a>Pillar Number 4: Your customer service can’t suck.</h2><p>Customer acquisition is hard. Customer retention is even harder.</p>
<p>If you have a high churn rate as a company, you’re going to find yourself constantly struggling to build something successful over the long term. What you’re looking for is repeat, happy customers, ideally the kind that then go on to recommend you to their friends.</p>
<p>This is the advice that Charles Zhong, CEO of<a href="https://www.azazie.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Azazie</a>, shared. Azazie has made a name for themselves in the bridal fashion world by disrupting the conventional industry, seeing 300% sales growth in 2017. Oh, and for those that say Millennials are impossible to deal with as employees, the average age of the company’s employees is 27.</p>
<p>“If you want to see what customer service looks like, step inside the world of bridal fashion. Consumers are tremendously particular, and you as a company are dealing with a very important occasion: someone’s wedding. In order for your internal team to work effectively, you have to communicate in a way that allows all parties to call out what isn’t working so that it can be fixed. We encourage our team members to ask questions, ask what people are struggling with, what needs more clarification or process, etc. We want everyone to feel heard,” said Zhong.</p>
<p>He went on to explain that, on the flipside, customer service that goes above and beyond is all about being personable. People already have the Internet to answer most questions. So when a customer reaches out, sometimes they just need a human to walk them through their specific case. The more human and personable that experience feels, the more likely that customer will be to return, because they trust you.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the front-end community, there is a lot of attention related to documenting JavaScript. That’s not so much the case with CSS. Often times I feel like lost when I join a project with minimal or no CSS documentation.</p>
<p>Even though CSS is relatively easy to write, it can be quite hard to maintain.The specificity, the global scope of everything, and the lack of guidance can easily lead to inconsistency, code duplication, and over-complication.</p>
<p>I’ve long been curious what a really well-documented CSS codebase looks like. Here, I’ll share my experience, along with the expectations I have towards my vision of well-documented stylesheets.</p>
<p>It surprises me where I hear people say that commenting CSS is not that important. I imagine none of them have had to deal with 10,000+ line stylesheets! Often I’ve struggled with what HTML results in what specific style. Without having a solid context about the development decisions taken, debugging efforts increase.<a href="http://commadot.com/wtf-per-minute/" target="_blank" rel="external">WTFs per minute</a>increase exponentially too.</p>
<p>Many times I’ve spent hours to figure out what the developer intended, why she didn’t do it the another way, why is this layout seemingly so complex. There is much pain buried in these “why” questions.</p>
<p>So, here we go! Let’s examine the 4 big signs of a well-documented CSS codebase.</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/mE3YfiU.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="1-CSS-Tech-Stack-amp-Toolchain"><a href="#1-CSS-Tech-Stack-amp-Toolchain" class="headerlink" title="1) CSS Tech Stack &amp; Toolchain"></a>1) CSS Tech Stack &amp; Toolchain</h3><p>There are likely things as part of our CSS code base like third-party libraries, mixins, or other tools. Looking in the package manager’s dependencies list doesn’t give a lot of context_why_the decisions were made to add these things, what they do exactly, and how we’re using them.</p>
<p>It would be good for everyone to know why a certain library or tool was introduced. Imagine, for example, that a third-party library was introduced only to solve what has become an obsolete CSS issue. If we had context like that, we could make more informed decisions.</p>
<p>There sometimes can be quite a few third-party libraries in a project. Have you ever spent a bunch of time on web searching each one figuring out what it even is? It can be quite a challenge to know or to keep track of what each exactly does.</p>
<p>A well-documented codebase would include a description for each dependency. Perhaps you could the comment tweet-length (140 characters) explaining why it is there. That would give anyone else in the code base a head start on why something is there.</p>
<p>I like adding these descriptions right in the place where I<code>@import</code>them.</p>
<h3 id="2-CSS-Conventions"><a href="#2-CSS-Conventions" class="headerlink" title="2) CSS Conventions"></a>2) CSS Conventions</h3><p>Good coding conventions result in consistent, readable, and unambiguous source code. They standardize the structure and coding style of an application so that you and others can easily read and understand the code.</p>
<p>It’s important to know if there are any project-specific naming conventions or methodologies in place (likeBEM,<a href="https://css-tricks.com/on-style-maintenance/#article-header-id-2" target="_blank" rel="external">OOCSS</a>,<a href="https://smacss.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">SMACSS</a>, orACSS). I’ve seen cases where a certain methodologies principles are applied but<a href="https://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/" target="_blank" rel="external">the actual rules followed are modified based on the preferences of the developers involved</a>. So an indication how strictly we must follow the methodology principles would be good to leave in a well-documented code base.</p>
<p>This brings up the larger issue of CSS style guides. A naming convention is just one choice as part of a complete styling strategy. Other parts might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>How is code sectioned?</li>
<li>How are files structured?</li>
<li><a href="https://css-tricks.com/poll-results-how-do-you-order-your-css-properties/" target="_blank" rel="external">How are properties ordered?</a></li>
<li>How is commenting done?</li>
<li>How is the formatting done (indentation, rule declarations)?</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/airbnb/css#javascript-hooks" target="_blank" rel="external">How to bind JavaScript hooks to classes?</a></li>
<li>… and many more rules or anti-patterns like nesting more then 3 levels deep, avoiding ID selectors,<br><a href="https://css-tricks.com/when-using-important-is-the-right-choice/" target="_blank" rel="external">using !important only for utility classes</a><br>and etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>All this makes up a completeCSS style guide. Having a shared vocabulary like this I’d consider a strong plus towards consistency.</p>
<h3 id="3-CSS-Architecture"><a href="#3-CSS-Architecture" class="headerlink" title="3) CSS Architecture"></a>3) CSS Architecture</h3><p>Most scalable projects follow some type of architecture in terms of ordering styles. In a well-documented codebase, the fundamental principles that the project follows when structuring and sectioning styles should be mentioned.</p>
<p>I was first inspired to explore CSS architecture by<a href="https://youtu.be/1OKZOV-iLj4" target="_blank" rel="external">watching Harry Roberts’s talk about managing CSS projects</a>. Here’s Harry:</p>
<p>CSS architecture seems to be somewhat in vogue right now. It’s something you’ve no doubt heard mentioned numerous times over the past year or so, and with good reason: UIs (and the teams that build them) are getting bigger and more complicated than ever before.</p>
<p>There are a number of aspects of CSS which make it troublesome. It’s declarative, meaning there is no logic or control flow to tell other developers much about the state or construction of the project. It operates in a global namespace, meaning we get collisions, leaking styles and inadvertent regressions. It utilizes inheritance, making everything somewhat interdependent and brittle. Finally, the unavoidable specificity model can cause problems when selectors fight each other for prominence.</p>
<p>Therefore, he<a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/manage-large-css-projects-itcss-101517528" target="_blank" rel="external">introduces a concept for architecting CSS called ITCSS</a>. If you are working on a project of reasonable scale, chances are someone already defined similar principles or ideas that aim to resolve these problems. So in a well-documented codebase, I would expect to see them written somewhere.</p>
<p>One could tell if the architecture is explained well enough if you can answer the following question: Where should new styles or stylesheets be added?</p>
<h3 id="4-CSS-Component-Descriptions-and-Examples"><a href="#4-CSS-Component-Descriptions-and-Examples" class="headerlink" title="4) CSS Component Descriptions and Examples"></a>4) CSS Component Descriptions and Examples</h3><p>A common pattern is to separate the logical modules into CSS components (or “blocks” according to BEM). Some of them might be re-usable, some may not, but the important thing is that they are the building blocks of our project. Therefore, describing what they are should be a top priority in a well-documented codebase.</p>
<p>Ideally, you should arrange and group them, name them, and establish rules between them to generate an overview of all components. A well-described CSS component doesn’t only include information about what the component does but also has other valuable intel like example HTML markup and the context in which it’s meant to be used. Going one step further brings up the issue of<a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/taking-pattern-libraries-next-level/" target="_blank" rel="external">Pattern Libraries</a>. A pattern library is a collection of reusable components that can be used together to create a website. With modular, component-based architecture becoming a trend, they can bring huge value.</p>
<p>The goal of a pattern library is to show what can be built with existing patterns (components). But let’s take a look at what additional information can be displayed alongside each pattern also. Vitaly Friedman shared a good summary on<a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/taking-pattern-libraries-next-level/" target="_blank" rel="external">how taking the pattern library to the next level looks like</a>. He states that focusing on components isn’t good enough:</p>
<p>One of the main problems with pattern libraries is that, while they provide an overview of components, they often leave a lot open to interpretation. Components can be combined in a variety of ways, consistently and inconsistently. It’s great to be able to see what button variants and iconography are available and what kinds of tables and pricing tags one may use, but what if you need to design or build an interface that contains all of these components at once — and perhaps another that doesn’t yet exist in the library?</p>
<p>A list of modules alone wouldn’t convey any context or any specifics on how the modules should (and should not) be used.</p>
<p>Based on Vitaly’s post and<a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/anatomy-of-a-pattern-in-a-pattern-library/" target="_blank" rel="external">Brad Frost’s anatomy of a pattern in a pattern library</a>, here are a few ideas I can imagine each of our patterns (components) could have, despite the usual unique name, code sample and a description of the component’s purpose. Basic (fundamental):</p>
<ul>
<li>Tags or categories: The assigned tags or categories for the component. Developers could tag their components with “in use”, “needs refactoring” tags and etc.</li>
<li>Responsive preview: A real-life, resizable preview of the component, using the actual snippet of code being used in production. Alternatively, just a screenshot.</li>
<li>Versioning and legacy, team members involved or responsible: In a bigger team, the ownership of the (family of) components and which team members have been actively developing them could be really helpful for maintenance and further development.</li>
</ul>
<p>… and here are a few more advanced:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance impact: Sometimes CSS could be heavy too. An indicator of performance or a “warning signs” section, outlining not only performance impact but also any common mishaps when the pattern is used incorrectly.</li>
<li>Accessibility implications: Indicator of accessibility requirements. Some components might require more work to maintain accessibility, especially if they interact with other components.</li>
<li>Related patterns: A quick overview of related components or the family of components that a given component belongs to. Could use an explanation of when to use a component, when not to, and why.</li>
<li>Fallback and print previews.</li>
</ul>
<p>… the list goes on and on to whatever makes sense for your specific use-case.</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>A well-documented CSS codebase enforces consistency, boosts maintainability, and helps the team to build a shared vocabulary. It is a prerequisite for efficient CSS design and development. Moreover, based on my experience, it inevitably leads to better performance. I strongly believe that these are the signs of the professional execution of a project.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Good design takes time and often years of experience and experimentation to getright.Itis built on certain conventions and rules that serve as the basis of a good design. A common example of a design convention is the use of contrasting colors to make text look better on a colored background.<strong>Vaunt</strong>is a free macOS that lets you find the dominant colors in an image. It’s a simple menu bar utility that you can drag &amp; drop imaged on to. It will find the dominant colors in an image and display all shades of it that appear in the image. You can click a color and its HEX code will automatically be copied to your clipboard.</p>
<p>Download and run Vaunt. It runs entirely from the menu bar. Click the menu bar icon to open the app and drag &amp; drop the image you want to analyze into the designated area. Give it a few seconds and it will show you a selection of colors that appear in the image.</p>
<p>Vaunt will show you multiple shades of the dominant color. It finds this color using a clustering algorithm and it accounts for the variation in shades by providing you different ones that it detects in the image. Click a color to copy its HEX code to your clipboard.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/mac-os/how-to-find-the-dominant-colors-in-an-image/attachment/vaunt/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://cloud.addictivetips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/vaunt.jpg" alt="" title="vaunt"></a></p>
<p>We tested the app out with a very psychedelic Alice in Wonderland wallpaper and the poster for Suicide Squad (2016). In both cases, there were two very distinct colors that were dominant in the image. We ran the images multiple times through Vaunt and it returned at least two different dominant colors for each image.</p>

<p>The color that Vaunt identifies as dominant depends on the area it analyzes. For images like posters or wallpapers, the results can vary greatly each time you run them through the app. This is because the app is looking at and analyzing a different part of the image. Vaunt can analyze both PNG and JPG images.</p>

<p>JavaScript is either placed in the HTML document within &lt;script&gt; tags (i.e., it is embedded in the HTML) or linked/referenced. There are currently a plethora of JavaScript libraries and frameworks, including jQuery, AngularJS, ReactJS, EmberJS, etc.</p>

<h3 id="What-is-AJAX"><a href="#What-is-AJAX" class="headerlink" title="What is AJAX?"></a>What is AJAX?</h3><p>AJAX, or Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, is a set of web development techniques combining JavaScript and XML that allows web applications to communicate with a server in the background without interfering with the current page. Asynchronous means that other functions or lines of code can run while the_async_script is running. XML used to be the primary language to pass data; however, the term AJAX is used for all types of data transfers (including JSON; I guess “AJAJ” doesn’t sound as clean as “AJAX” [pun intended]).</p>
<p>A common use of AJAX is to update the content or layout of a webpage without initiating a full page refresh. Normally, when a page loads, all the assets on the page must be requested and fetched from the server and then rendered on the page. However, with AJAX, only the assets that differ between pages need to be loaded, which improves the user experience as they do not have to refresh the entire page.</p>
<p>One can think of AJAX as mini server calls. A good example of AJAX in action is Google Maps. The page updates without a full page reload (i.e., mini server calls are being used to load content as the user navigates).</p>

<h3 id="What-is-the-Document-Object-Model-DOM"><a href="#What-is-the-Document-Object-Model-DOM" class="headerlink" title="What is the Document Object Model (DOM)?"></a>What is the Document Object Model (DOM)?</h3><p>As an SEO professional, you need to understand what the DOM is, because it’s what Google is using to analyze and understand webpages.</p>
<p>The DOM is what you see when you “Inspect Element” in a browser. Simply put, you can think of the DOM as the steps the browser takes after receiving the HTML document to render the page.</p>
<p>The first thing the browser receives is the HTML document. After that, it will start parsing the content within this document and fetch additional resources, such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files.</p>
<p>The DOM is what forms from this parsing of information and resources. One can think of it as a structured, organized version of the webpage’s code.</p>
<p>Nowadays the DOM is often very different from the initial HTML document, due to what’s collectively called<em>dynamic HTML</em>. Dynamic HTML is the ability for a page to change its content depending on user input, environmental conditions (e.g. time of day), and other variables, leveraging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
<p>Simple example with a &lt;title&gt; tag that is populated through JavaScript:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left">HTML source</th>
<th style="text-align:left">DOM</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/QBJ3qeM.png!web" alt=""></td>

<h3 id="What-is-headless-browsing"><a href="#What-is-headless-browsing" class="headerlink" title="What is headless browsing?"></a>What is headless browsing?</h3><p>Headless browsing is simply the action of fetching webpages without the user interface. It is important to understand because Google,<a href="https://www.merkleinc.com/blog/baidu-adds-new-spider-rendering-job" target="_blank" rel="external">and now Baidu</a>, leverage headless browsing to gain a better understanding of the user’s experience and the content of webpages.</p>
<p><a href="http://phantomjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">PhantomJS</a>and<a href="http://zombie.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Zombie.js</a>are scripted headless browsers, typically used for automating web interaction for testing purposes, and rendering static HTML snapshots for initial requests (pre-rendering).</p>

(and how to fix issues)"></a>Why can JavaScript be challenging for SEO? (and how to fix issues)</h2><p>There are three (3) primary reasons to be concerned about JavaScript on your site:</p>
<ol>
<li>Crawlability: Bots’ ability to crawl your site.</li>
<li>Obtainability: Bots’ ability to access information and parse your content.</li>
<li>Perceived site latency: AKA the Critical Rendering Path.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/bAVB7bI.png!web" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="Crawlability"><a href="#Crawlability" class="headerlink" title="Crawlability"></a>Crawlability</h3><p>Are bots able to find URLs and understand your site’s architecture? There are two important elements here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Blocking search engines from your JavaScript (even accidentally).</li>
<li>Proper internal linking, not leveraging JavaScript events as a replacement for HTML tags.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="Why-is-blocking-JavaScript-such-a-big-deal"><a href="#Why-is-blocking-JavaScript-such-a-big-deal" class="headerlink" title="Why is blocking JavaScript such a big deal?"></a>Why is blocking JavaScript such a big deal?</h4><p>If search engines are<a href="https://moz.com/blog/why-all-seos-should-unblock-js-css" target="_blank" rel="external">blocked from crawling JavaScript</a>, they will not be receiving your site’s full experience. This means search engines are not seeing what the end user is seeing. This can reduce your site’s appeal to search engines and could eventually be considered cloaking (if the intent is indeed malicious).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/googlebot-fetch" target="_blank" rel="external">Fetch as Google</a>and TechnicalSEO.com’s<a href="https://technicalseo.com/seo-tools/robots-txt/" target="_blank" rel="external">robots.txt</a>and<a href="https://technicalseo.com/seo-tools/fetch-render/" target="_blank" rel="external">Fetch and Render</a>testing tools can help to identify resources that Googlebot is blocked from.</p>
<p>The easiest way to solve this problem is through providing search engines access to the resources they need to understand your user experience.</p>
<p>_!!! Important note:_Work with your development team to determine which files should and should not be accessible to search engines.</p>
<h4 id="Internal-linking"><a href="#Internal-linking" class="headerlink" title="Internal linking"></a>Internal linking</h4><p>Internal linking should be implemented with regular anchor tags within the HTML or the DOM (using an<a href="https://moz.com/blog/www.example.com" target="_blank" rel="external">HTML tag) versus leveraging JavaScript functions to allow the user to traverse the site.</a></p>
<p>Essentially: Don’t use JavaScript’s onclick events as a replacement for internal linking. While end URLs might be found and crawled (through strings in JavaScript code or XML sitemaps), they won’t be associated with the global navigation of the site.</p>
<p>Internal linking is a strong signal to search engines regarding the site’s architecture and importance of pages. In fact, internal links are so strong that they can (in certain situations) override “SEO hints” such as canonical tags.</p>
<h4 id="URL-structure"><a href="#URL-structure" class="headerlink" title="URL structure"></a>URL structure</h4><p>Historically, JavaScript-based websites (aka “AJAX sites”) were using fragment identifiers (#) within URLs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Not recommended:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>The Lone Hash (#) –</strong><br>The lone pound symbol is not crawlable. It is used to identify anchor link (aka jump links). These are the links that allow one to jump to a piece of content on a page. Anything after the lone hash portion of the URL is never sent to the server and will cause the page to automatically scroll to the first element with a matching ID (or the first<br>&lt;<br>a<br>&gt;<br> element with a name of the following information).<br><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+JohnMueller/posts/LT4fU7kFB8W" target="_blank" rel="external">Google recommends</a><br>avoiding the use of “#“ in URLs.</li>
<li><strong>Hashbang (#!) (and</strong><br><a href="https://developers.google.com/webmasters/ajax-crawling/docs/specification" target="_blank" rel="external"><strong>escaped_fragments</strong></a><br><strong>URLs) –</strong><br>Hashbang URLs were a hack to support crawlers (Google wants to avoid now and only Bing supports). Many a moon ago, Google and Bing developed a complicated AJAX solution, whereby a pretty (#!) URL with the UX co-existed with an equivalent escaped_fragment HTML-based experience for bots. Google has since backtracked on this recommendation, preferring to receive the exact user experience. In escaped fragments, there are two experiences here:<ul>
<li><strong>Original Experience (aka Pretty URL):</strong><br>This URL must either have a #! (hashbang) within the URL to indicate that there is an escaped fragment or a meta element indicating that an escaped fragment exists (<br>&lt;<br>meta name=”fragment” content=”!”<br>&gt;<br>).</li>
<li><strong>Escaped Fragment (aka Ugly URL, HTML snapshot):</strong><br>This URL replace the hashbang (#!) with “_escaped_fragment_” and serves the HTML snapshot. It is called the ugly URL because it’s long and looks like (and for all intents and purposes is) a hack.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Recommended:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>pushState History API –</strong><br>PushState is navigation-based and part of the History API (think: your web browsing history). Essentially, pushState updates the URL in the address bar and only what needs to change on the page is updated. It allows JS sites to leverage “clean” URLs. PushState is currently<br><a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2016/11/building-indexable-progressive-web-apps.html" target="_blank" rel="external">supported by Google</a><br>, when supporting browser navigation for client-side or hybrid rendering.<ul>
<li>A good use of pushState is for infinite scroll (i.e., as the user hits new parts of the page the URL will update). Ideally, if the user refreshes the page, the experience will land them in the exact same spot. However, they do not need to refresh the page, as the content updates as they scroll down, while the URL is updated in the address bar.</li>
<li>Example: A good example of a search engine-friendly infinite scroll implementation, created by Google’s John Mueller (go figure), can be found<br><a href="http://scrollsample.appspot.com/items" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a><br>. He technically leverages the replaceState(), which doesn’t include the same back button functionality as pushState.</li>

<h3 id="Obtainability"><a href="#Obtainability" class="headerlink" title="Obtainability"></a>Obtainability</h3><p>Search engines have been shown to employ headless browsing to render the DOM to gain a better understanding of the user’s experience and the content on page. That is to say, Google can process some JavaScript and uses the DOM (instead of the HTML document).</p>
<p>At the same time, there are situations where search engines struggle to comprehend JavaScript. Nobody wants<a href="http://www.linkresearchtools.com/case-studies/hulu-javascript-fail-visibility-drop/" target="_blank" rel="external">a Hulu situation</a>to happen to their site or a client’s site. It is crucial to understand how bots are interacting with your onsite content. When you aren’t sure, test.</p>
<p>Assuming we’re talking about a search engine bot that executes JavaScript, there are a few important elements for search engines to be able to obtain content:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the user must interact for something to fire, search engines probably aren’t seeing it.<ul>
<li>Google is a lazy user. It doesn’t click, it doesn’t scroll, and it doesn’t log in. If the full UX demands action from the user, special precautions should be taken to ensure that bots are receiving an equivalent experience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the JavaScript occurs after the JavaScript load event fires plus ~5-seconds*, search engines may not be seeing it.<ul>
<li>*<br><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/js-sites-wg/ZFBMv2TcB3M" target="_blank" rel="external">John Mueller mentioned</a><br>that there is no specific timeout value; however, sites should aim to load within five seconds.</li>
<li>*<br><a href="https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/crawl-javascript-seo/" target="_blank" rel="external">Screaming Frog tests</a><br>show a correlation to five seconds to render content.</li>
<li>*The load event plus five seconds is what Google’s PageSpeed Insights, Mobile Friendliness Tool, and Fetch as Google use; check out<br><a href="https://maxxeight.com/tests/js-timer/" target="_blank" rel="external">Max Prin’s test timer</a><br>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If there are errors within the JavaScript, both browsers and search engines won’t be able to go through and potentially miss sections of pages if the entire code is not executed.</li>
</ul>

TEST"></a>1. TEST</h4><p>The most popular solution to resolving JavaScript is probably not resolving anything (grab a coffee and let Google work its algorithmic brilliance). Providing Google with the same experience as searchers is<a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2015/10/deprecating-our-ajax-crawling-scheme.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Google’s preferred scenario</a>.</p>
<p>Google first announced being able to “better understand the web (i.e., JavaScript)” in<a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/05/understanding-web-pages-better.html" target="_blank" rel="external">May 2014</a>. Industry experts suggested that Google could crawl JavaScript way before this announcement. The iPullRank team offered two great pieces on this in 2011:<a href="http://ipullrank.com/googlebot-is-chrome/" target="_blank" rel="external">Googlebot is Chrome</a>and<a href="https://moz.com/blog/just-how-smart-are-search-robots" target="_blank" rel="external">How smart are Googlebots?</a>(thank you, Josh and Mike). Adam Audette’s<a href="http://searchengineland.com/tested-googlebot-crawls-javascript-heres-learned-220157" target="_blank" rel="external">Google can crawl JavaScript and leverages the DOM</a>in 2015 confirmed. Therefore, if you can see your content in the DOM, chances are your content is being parsed by Google.</p>
<p><img src="http://img1.tuicool.com/ZJj6VrV.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>Recently, Barry Goralewicz performed<a href="https://goralewicz.com/blog/javascript-seo-experiment/" target="_blank" rel="external">a cool experiment testing a combination of various JavaScript libraries and frameworks</a>to determine how Google interacts with the pages (e.g., are they indexing URL/content? How does GSC interact? Etc.). It ultimately showed that Google is able to interact with many forms of JavaScript and highlighted certain frameworks as perhaps more challenging.<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/js-sites-wg" target="_blank" rel="external">John Mueller even started a JavaScript search group</a>(from what I’ve read, it’s fairly therapeutic).</p>
<p>All of these studies are amazing and help SEOs understand when to be concerned and take a proactive role. However, before you determine that sitting back is the right solution for your site, I recommend being actively cautious by experimenting with small section Think: Jim Collin’s “bullets, then cannonballs” philosophy from his book<a href="http://www.jimcollins.com/books/great-by-choice.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Great by Choice</a>:</p>
<p>“A bullet is an empirical test aimed at learning what works and meets three criteria: a bullet must be low-cost, low-risk, and low-distraction… 10Xers use bullets to empirically validate what will actually work. Based on that empirical validation, they then concentrate their resources to fire a cannonball, enabling large returns from concentrated bets.”</p>
<p>Consider testing and reviewing through the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Confirm that your content is appearing within the DOM.</li>
<li>Test a subset of pages to see if Google can index content.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Manually check quotes from your content.</li>
<li><p>Fetch with Google and see if content appears.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fetch with Google supposedly occurs around the load event or before timeout. It’s a great test to check to see if Google will be able to see your content and whether or not you’re blocking JavaScript in your robots.txt. Although Fetch with Google is not foolproof, it’s a good starting point.</p>
</li>
<li>Note: If you aren’t verified in GSC, try<br><a href="https://technicalseo.com/seo-tools/fetch-render/" target="_blank" rel="external">Technicalseo.com’s Fetch and Render As Any Bot Tool</a><br>.</li>
</ul>
<p>After you’ve tested all this, what if something’s not working and search engines and bots are struggling to index and obtain your content? Perhaps you’re concerned about alternative search engines (DuckDuckGo, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.), or maybe you’re leveraging meta information that needs to be parsed by other bots, such as Twitter summary cards or Facebook Open Graph tags. If any of this is identified in testing or presents itself as a concern, an HTML snapshot may be the only decision.</p>
<h4 id="2-HTML-SNAPSHOTS"><a href="#2-HTML-SNAPSHOTS" class="headerlink" title="2. HTML SNAPSHOTS"></a>2. HTML SNAPSHOTS</h4><h4 id="What-are-HTmL-snapshots"><a href="#What-are-HTmL-snapshots" class="headerlink" title="What are HTmL snapshots?"></a>What are HTmL snapshots?</h4><p>HTML snapshots are a fully rendered page (as one might see in the DOM) that can be returned to search engine bots (think: a static HTML version of the DOM).</p>
<p><a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2009/10/proposal-for-making-ajax-crawlable.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Google introduced HTML snapshots 2009</a>,<a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2015/10/deprecating-our-ajax-crawling-scheme.html" target="_blank" rel="external">deprecated (but still supported) them in 2015</a>, and awkwardly mentioned them as<a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2016/11/building-indexable-progressive-web-apps.html" target="_blank" rel="external">an element to “avoid”</a>in late 2016. HTML snapshots are a contentious topic with Google. However, they’re important to understand, because in certain situations they’re necessary.</p>
<p>If search engines (or sites like Facebook) cannot grasp your JavaScript, it’s better to return an HTML snapshot than not to have your content indexed and understood at all. Ideally, your site would leverage some form of user-agent detection on the server side and return the HTML snapshot to the bot.</p>
<p>At the same time, one must recognize that Google wants the same experience as the user (i.e., only provide Google with an HTML snapshot if the tests are dire and the<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/js-sites-wg" target="_blank" rel="external">JavaScript search group</a>cannot provide support for your situation).</p>
<h4 id="Considerations"><a href="#Considerations" class="headerlink" title="Considerations"></a>Considerations</h4><p>When considering HTML snapshots, you must consider that Google has deprecated this AJAX recommendation. Although Google technically still supports it, Google recommends avoiding it. Yes, Google changed its mind and now want to receive the same experience as the user. This direction makes sense, as it allows the bot to receive an experience more true to the user experience.</p>
<p>A second consideration factor relates to the risk of cloaking. If the HTML snapshots are found to not represent the experience on the page, it’s considered a cloaking risk. Straight from the source:</p>
<p>“The HTML snapshot must contain the same content as the end user would see in a browser. If this is not the case, it may be considered cloaking.”</p>
<p>–<a href="https://developers.google.com/webmasters/ajax-crawling/docs/faq#cloaking" target="_blank" rel="external">Google Developer AJAX Crawling FAQs</a></p>
<h4 id="Benefits"><a href="#Benefits" class="headerlink" title="Benefits"></a>Benefits</h4><p>Despite the considerations, HTML snapshots have powerful advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Knowledge that search engines and crawlers will be able to understand the experience.<ul>
<li>Certain types of JavaScript may be harder for Google to grasp (cough… Angular (also colloquially referred to as AngularJS 2) …cough).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other search engines and crawlers (think: Bing, Facebook) will be able to understand the experience.<ul>
<li>Bing, among other search engines, has not stated that it can crawl and index JavaScript. HTML snapshots may be the only solution for a JavaScript-heavy site. As always, test to make sure that this is the case before diving in.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/ZRRz6rR.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="Site-latency"><a href="#Site-latency" class="headerlink" title="Site latency"></a>Site latency</h4><p>When browsers receive an HTML document and create the DOM (although there is some level of pre-scanning), most resources are loaded as they appear within the HTML document. This means that if you have a huge file toward the top of your HTML document, a browser will load that immense file first.</p>
<p>The concept of Google’s critical rendering path is to load what the user needs as soon as possible, which can be translated to → “get everything above-the-fold in front of the user, ASAP.”</p>
<h4 id="Critical-Rendering-Path-Optimized-Rendering-Loads-Progressively-ASAP"><a href="#Critical-Rendering-Path-Optimized-Rendering-Loads-Progressively-ASAP" class="headerlink" title="Critical Rendering Path - Optimized Rendering Loads Progressively ASAP:"></a>Critical Rendering Path - Optimized Rendering Loads Progressively ASAP:</h4><p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/zMjQFrF.png!web" alt=""></p>
<p>Image<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/" target="_blank" rel="external">source</a></p>
<p>However, if you have unnecessary resources or JavaScript files clogging up the page’s ability to load, you get “render-blocking JavaScript.” Meaning: your JavaScript is blocking the page’s potential to appear as if it’s loading faster (also called: perceived latency).</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/BVNRN3B.png!web" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="Render-blocking-JavaScript-–-Solutions"><a href="#Render-blocking-JavaScript-–-Solutions" class="headerlink" title="Render-blocking JavaScript – Solutions"></a>Render-blocking JavaScript – Solutions</h4><p>If you analyze your page speed results (through tools like<a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/" target="_blank" rel="external">Page Speed Insights Tool</a>,<a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">WebPageTest.org</a>, CatchPoint, etc.) and determine that there is a render-blocking JavaScript issue, here are three potential solutions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Inline: Add the JavaScript in the HTML document.</li>
<li><p>Async: Make JavaScript asynchronous (i.e., add “async” attribute to HTML tag).</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/Bba67bj.png!web" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li>Defer: By placing JavaScript lower within the HTML.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="http://img1.tuicool.com/FbU7n2N.png!web" alt=""></p>
<p>_!!! Important note:_It’s important to understand that scripts must be arranged in order of precedence. Scripts that are used to load the above-the-fold content must be prioritized and should not be deferred. Also, any script that references another file can only be used after the referenced file has loaded. Make sure to work closely with your development team to confirm that there are no interruptions to the user’s experience.</p>

Make sure your content is crawlable, obtainable, and isn’t developing site latency obstructions. The key = every situation demands testing. Based on the results, evaluate potential solutions.</p>

<p>The Armani brand is already synonymous with high fashion, and now the company wants to add smartwatches to its lineup. Armani announced that its firstAndroid Wear 2.0 device, the Emporio Armani Connected, will go on sale in its stores starting on September 14. The company previously<a href="http://www.androidauthority.com/emporio-armani-connected-hybrid-watch-725061/" target="_blank" rel="external">released a hybrid smartwatch</a>that went on sale in the fall of 2016.</p>

<p>The new touchscreen wearable will be one of the over 300 different hybrid and full smartwatches<a href="http://www.androidauthority.com/fossil-goes-full-android-wear-300-connected-watches-planned-year-759053/" target="_blank" rel="external">that will be made by Fossil</a>, which is also making and marketing devices for other fashion brands like Michael Kors, Skagen, Diesel, DKNY, and Marc Jacobs. In this case, the Emporio Armani Connected will be sold with support for up to eight different straps, along with a number of exclusive watchfaces. There’s not a lot of info on its hardware specs, but on the surface it looks it will be fairly typical Android Wear smartwatch, with a round display and a Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor inside.</p>
<p>However, you are paying for the brand name, not the hardware, when you decide to get the Emporio Armani Connected. Pricing has not yet been announced but we expect it to be on the higher side of Android Wear products.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A long time ago I bought an Ethernet ENC28J60 but I just recently tested it and, although I enjoy Java and I’ve used it in all of my previous projects to develop the interface between Arduino and server, it was clear to me that Python would be a much better choice in this case.</p>
<p>In 2014, I decided to use<a href="https://panamahitek.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Panama Hitek Arduino SDK</a>and then I sent them an email sharing my experience with their new SDK version. In 2016, I randomly met the guys from the Panama Hitek at the Fedora Latin America Meeting in IRC. Sharing your experience as a developer and be engaging in communities is very important, maybe you will meet the developers of your favorite framework in these spaces or even work with them. For me, it’s one more example of the importance of sharing knowledge and ideas through articles, talks, meetings etc. So, don’t be shy or scared of sharing what you know.</p>
<h2 id="IoT-is-about-being-connected"><a href="#IoT-is-about-being-connected" class="headerlink" title="IoT is about being connected"></a>IoT is about being connected</h2><p>IoT, embedded systems and smart devices are different concepts and there’s a constant confusion when using these terms.</p>
<p>If your device is disconnected from Internet, it probably isn’t generating the value of an IoT device. Being connected is more than reading commands remotely from an app, it’s a possibility to interact in different ways with your client and other systems like Twitter and also to collect useful information that can be used to make it even smarter.</p>
<h2 id="First-step"><a href="#First-step" class="headerlink" title="First step"></a>First step</h2><p>Register your app in Twitter to consume their API. Access<a href="https://apps.twitter.com/app/new" target="_blank" rel="external">Twitter Dev</a>to create your Twitter application and generate an access token to enable tweeting from your account (“Keys and Access Tokens” &gt; “Create my access token”)</p>

There’s a<a href="https://arduino-tweet.appspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Tweet Library for Arduino</a>available but it’s deprecated and needs refactoring to work with Arduino versions higher than 1.6.4.</p>

<h3 id="The-easy-way"><a href="#The-easy-way" class="headerlink" title="The easy way"></a>The easy way</h3><p>Working with pointers and in a low level can be complicated if you don’t have experience with C and micro-controller, registers, digital systems etc. Use a python script and it will be much easier to code and maintain the software. Python will be responsible for exposing a web server which will then be consumed by your Arduino and send the content (e.g, sensor values, commands to turn on or off the lights etc) to Twitter. Note that Arduino UNO has limitations when building HTTP requests (it was necessary to use GET method instead of POST to create a tweet) and for this reason Python<strong>doesn’t expose an API</strong>.</p>

<p>EtherShield and ETHER_28J60 are common libraries used in most of tutorials, but UIPEthernet is compatible with the original Ethernet which allows you to use the examples avaiable in the Arduino IDE (File &gt; Examples &gt; Ethernet) just by replacing:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My first encounter with the gdb command<code>duel</code>was on some old IRIX about 15 years ago. I immediately loved how convenient it was for displaying various data structures during MySQL debugging, and I wished Linux had something similar. Later I found out that Duel was not something IRIX specific, but a public domain patch for gdb 4.6 written in ’93 by Michael Golan. Unfortunately, it never got into gdb (for licensing reasons, so I’ve heard). Now the gdb 8 is out, and the patch, obviously doesn’t apply. Instead of fixing the patch, I’ve re-implemented Duel in Python, using<a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Python-API.html" target="_blank" rel="external">gdb Python API</a>and the<a href="https://github.com/igordejanovic/Arpeggio" target="_blank" rel="external">Arpeggio</a>parser. Now it can be loaded run-time into your gdb, no patching or compilation is needed. And, hopefully, it will work over many gdb versions, as it no longer relies on undocumented gdb internals. So, allow me to introduce…<strong>Duel.py</strong>for gdb!</p>
<h2 id="Examples"><a href="#Examples" class="headerlink" title="Examples"></a>Examples</h2><p>Let’s start with a few examples, to get the taste of it. Michael Golan managed to create a concise but very naturally-looking language. For example, while<code>a-&gt;b</code>means the element<code>b</code>of the structure pointer<code>a</code>, in Duel<code>a--&gt;b</code>means to walk the linked list, producing the sequence of values<code>a</code>,<code>a-&gt;b</code>,<code>a-&gt;b-&gt;b</code>, and so on. In MariaDB, all tables of a query are stored in a linked list, and it can be printed with just one command:</p>

<p>Also, quite naturally, instead of a number, you can specify a range, great for printing arrays:</p>

<h2 id="Concepts"><a href="#Concepts" class="headerlink" title="Concepts"></a>Concepts</h2><p>Duel is built on the idea that every expression can return multiple values.

<p>Besides operators that generate multiple values, there are operators that stop generation and grep-like operators that filter generated values. Let’s take a closer look.</p>
<h2 id="Operators"><a href="#Operators" class="headerlink" title="Operators"></a>Operators</h2><p>Duel syntax is C-like, C operators work as expected, one can use C-style casts, refer to variables and invoke functions of the inferior (program, being debugged). But additionally one can use special Duel operators that deal with multiple values.</p>
<h4 id="Ranges-and-lists-and"><a href="#Ranges-and-lists-and" class="headerlink" title="Ranges and lists,..and,"></a>Ranges and lists,<code>..</code>and<code>,</code></h4><p>You’ve seen examples above. These operators look rather familiar, they exist in other languages too. A range can have both or only one end specified,<code>..x</code>means a range of<code>x</code>elements, same as<code>0..x-1</code>. An open range<code>x..</code>will generate values ad infinitum (or until the counter overflows, whatever comes first), one usually uses it with the<code>@</code>“until” operator.</p>
<h4 id="Until"><a href="#Until" class="headerlink" title="Until,@"></a>Until,<code>@</code></h4><p>In the<code>x@y</code>expression,<code>x</code>will keep generating values until<code>y</code>becomes true. For example,</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div><div class="line">7</div><div class="line">8</div><div class="line">9</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">(gdb) </div><div class="line">dl</div><div class="line"> arr[</div><div class="line">0</div><div class="line">..]@(</div><div class="line">count</div><div class="line">&gt;</div><div class="line">10</div><div class="line">)</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>will print elements of the<code>arr</code>array, until<code>arr[i].count</code>becomes larger than ten. As a convenient shortcut, the second argument can be a constant, in this case the generation stops as soon as the generated value becomes equal to this constant. For example, to print all command-line arguments:</p>

<p>Note, how in the second example curly braces allow us to see what array elements satisfy the condition.</p>
<h4 id="Filters-lt-gt-lt-gt"><a href="#Filters-lt-gt-lt-gt" class="headerlink" title="Filters,&lt;?,&gt;?,&lt;=?,&gt;=?,==?,!=?"></a>Filters,<code>&lt;?</code>,<code>&gt;?</code>,<code>&lt;=?</code>,<code>&gt;=?</code>,<code>==?</code>,<code>!=?</code></h4><p>These operators work kind of like grep, they select values of left argument that satisfy the condition. In other words, the result of<code>x ==? y</code>is<code>x</code>, if it’s equal to<code>y</code>, otherwise there is no result at all. The previous, rather complex, example could be simplified using filters:</p>

<li>Creating a Suggestion Dropdown</li>
</ul>
<p>As far as dropdowns go, the most popular one on the Internet is Google’s AutoSuggest.</p>
<p>As you start to type, Google tries to guess what the user is looking for and provides a dropdown with suggestions so the user doesn’t have to type everything.</p>
<p>In the last post of this [link]series, we’ll discuss how to create a autosuggest dropdown control for your own UI.</p>
<h2 id="Overview"><a href="#Overview" class="headerlink" title="Overview"></a>Overview</h2><p>Throughout this series, you already know by now that we need to write JavaScript for our control.</p>
<p>For our autosuggest dropdown, we’ll use a standard Text Box along with a custom DIV that displays below it.</p>
<p>As the user types in the text box, we’ll take their input and send it back to the server using a Web API.</p>
<p>This is probably the only post in the series without a ViewModel since everything is done through JavaScript.</p>
<h2 id="Our-WebAPI"><a href="#Our-WebAPI" class="headerlink" title="Our WebAPI"></a>Our WebAPI</h2><p>For our autosuggest to work, we need a Web API similar to our<a href="https://www.danylkoweb.com/Blog/cascading-dropdowns-in-aspnet-mvc-JY" target="_blank" rel="external">Cascading Dropdown WebAPI</a>.</p>
<p>It’s similar, but instead we want distinct make and models of cars and we only want 10 of them displayed in the dropdown.</p>

<p>When the user presses a key, we check to see the following codes:</p>
<ul>
<li>ESC (27) - Close the dropdown when it’s visible.</li>
<li>Down Arrow (40) - Move to the next option in the dropdown.</li>
<li>Up Arrow (38) - Move to the previous option in the dropdown.</li>
<li>Enter (13) - Select the highlighted item in the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, when none of our keys are caught, we assume the user is entering their search criteria.</p>
<p>We show the “dropdown” by removing the hidden CSS class and make our call to the Web API.</p>
<p>Once retrieved, we add the items to our list and attach click events to our anchors in the list.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In this final post to our dropdown series, I wanted to show how easy it is to create an autosuggest dropdown. Not only did we make our dropdown list clickable, we also added keyboard events for those keyboard-jockeys who avoid the mouse.</p>
<p>This dropdown series explained thebasics of dropdowns, how to use<a href="https://www.danylkoweb.com/Blog/using-dropdowns-in-grids-JX" target="_blank" rel="external">dropdowns inside and outside of webgrids</a>, mutiple ways to<a href="https://www.danylkoweb.com/Blog/cascading-dropdowns-in-aspnet-mvc-JY" target="_blank" rel="external">implement cascading dropdowns</a>, and, of course, how to create an autosuggest dropdown.</p>
<p>I hope this series has shown a detailed and easy way to implement dropdowns in ASP.NET MVC.</p>
<p>Was this autosuggest easy to implement? Is there a better way to do this? Post your comments below and let’s discuss.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple added a new feature in the<a href="https://www.addictivetips.com/ios/how-to-set-up-the-bedtime-alarm-in-ios-10/" target="_blank" rel="external">iOS clock app called Bed Time</a>. The feature helps you get 7-8 hours of sleep everyday. It asks you what time it is you have to wake up the next day, and then tells you when to go to bed. It’s useful considering most people use their phones as an alarm. The only thing is, if you’re awake and working, the device you’re looking at is going to be a desktop, not your phone.<strong>Sandman</strong>is a desktop app available for Windows, Mac, and Linux that does something similar to the iOS clock app. It gives you bed time alerts that ensure you get 7-8 hours of sleep.</p>
<p>Sandman looks at two things when it gives you bed time alerts; your working hours, and when you need to wake up. The app was designed with developers in mind who are prone to working long hours and missing essential sleep. The app learns what times a user works and tells them when enough is enough and they should go to bed.</p>
<p>Open Sandman. When you start out, it doesn’t know what your work schedule is. All you can do is tell the app when you need to wake up. It will work with that until it knows you schedule better.</p>

<p>When it’s time for bed, Sandman will give you an alert. You can dismiss it if you don’t like sleep, or you can use the Shutdown button on the alert to turn your system off and hit the hay.</p>

<p>Sandman is pretty smart. It takes into account how long you need to fall asleep. Some people fall asleep almost immediately. Other people stay awake for a few hours contemplating the meaning of life. Sandman’s bed time alerts can factor that time in. To configure how long it takes to for you to fall asleep, go to Sandman’s preferences via the Ctrl+P  shortcut.</p>
<p>Set how long it takes you to fall asleep. Sandman can also alert you when you’ve been working for twelve hours straight though you can customize this time slot to make it shorter or longer. Additionally, you can switch from the 12 hour format to the 24 hour format if you like.</p>

<p>If you lose track of time when you’re working then consider using Sandman. Work is important but doing it in a sleep deprived state is hardly good for you.</p>
<p>You can dismiss an alert from Sandman if you’re not ready to go to bed, but don’t make a habit of it. Try and get the required sleep you need everyday.</p>

<h3 id="About-“wants”-“cans”-“needs”-and-“shoulds”"><a href="#About-“wants”-“cans”-“needs”-and-“shoulds”" class="headerlink" title="About “wants”, “cans”, “needs”, and “shoulds”"></a>About “wants”, “cans”, “needs”, and “shoulds”</h3><p>The original<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/search?q=volume&amp;restrict_sr=on" target="_blank" rel="external">reddit post</a>has now hundreds of examples of terrible volume UI, and it keeps growing — a fun exercise/joke, that can strengthen one’s creative muscles and ability to think outside of the box. People have been participating simply for the fun of coming up with the most absurd and weird interactions and interface elements.</p>
<p>But there’s definitely a reflection point about the state our industry here.</p>
<p>I’m sure a lot of people reading this has, at some point in their careers,<strong>felt that urge of innovating no matter what</strong>. An uncontrollable desire of redesigning something that hasn’t been redesigned for too long. It_has_to be recreated. And it_has_to be innovative. Right?</p>
<p>That’s where the wants, cans, needs, and shoulds story comes in.</p>
<ul>
<li>Everybody<br><strong>wants</strong><br>to innovate. The design industry keeps nudging us to be creative, innovative, and to deliver design solutions that have never been thought of before. Pressure is on us. We are bombarded with messages telling us that, in order to be considered a solid designer, we<br><em>have</em><br>to innovate at any cost.</li>
<li>A lot of people<br><strong>can</strong><br>innovate. I definitely<br><em>can</em><br>redesign the volume control UI. All it takes is a bit of creativity and moderate design skills. Prototyping tools are becoming increasingly accessible, as well as other technologies that allow to bring to fruition whatever idea comes to mind. A few hours in front of Principle or Framer lets you create an extremely refined prototype of the interaction you are envisioning. You can also decide to create an app/site/chatbot to solve that same issue. You<br><em>can</em><br>.</li>
<li>No one<br><strong>needs</strong><br>to. Let’s be honest: the volume control design pattern has been around for decades, works pretty well for the majority of users, and is incredibly familiar to a lot of people. You don’t<br><em>need</em><br>to reinvent it.</li>
</ul>
<p>But then there’s the<strong>should</strong>.</p>
<p>ShouldI redesign the volume control UI?</p>
<p>Shouldis interesting because of its subjectiveness. It’s a question that only makes sense to be asked in first person. And you_have_to know about much more than just design to be able to answer it — you have to understand about business, technology, culture, people. Answering the<strong>should</strong>question is a skill you only get after many, many years answering questions alike.</p>
<p>We can try to quantify or measure the should, which makes sense some of the time. But part of it is, and will ever be, intuition. How is yours?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When a system goes to sleep, it preserves the state it was in. If you had apps and files open on your desktop, they will still be there when you get back. Everything from your work setup to your system configurations is stored. When you wake your system, you can pick up work where you left it off. macOS is no different. When it wakes from sleep, everything is exactly where you left it which is a good thing except in the case of your system’s volume. The volume is one thing that you might want to reset when you wake your system. If you left the volume high because you were playing music, it might startle you when you wake your system from sleep. Here’s how you can change the system volume on wake on macOS.</p>
<p>To change the system volume on wake, you need an app called<strong>AutoVolume</strong>. It’s a free open source macOS app that well reset the system volume when you wake your Mac from sleep.</p>
<p>Download and run AutoVolume. The app has a very basic interface. You set the volume you want your Mac to reset to when it wakes from sleep and enable it. Once you’ve set the volume, enable the app and close it. Be careful you don’t click the ‘Quit’ button. Quitting the app is different from closing it. If you quit the app, it will not change the system volume on Wake.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/mac-os/change-the-system-volume-on-wake-macos/attachment/autovolume/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://cloud.addictivetips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AutoVolume.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>After you set the volume level, you can forget about the app. You won’t see any indication of the app running. It doesn’t so much as have a Menu bar icon. When you’re done, either put your Mac to sleep or let it enter sleep automatically.</p>

<p>When you wake your Mac to use it the next time around, the volume will have changed to the one you set in AutoVolume.</p>
<p>Although you can set AutoVolume to run at start up, it doesn’t change the system volume when you boot your Mac. This app in its current state is meant to work only when you wake your Mac. If you normally let your Mac go to sleep instead of shutting it down at the end of each day, AutoVolume will ensure you or your co-workers aren’t blasted with loud audio notifications or music.</p>
<p>The app is still under development and it has an interesting list of requested features so, even if it isn’t feature rich at the moment, it’s an app you want to keep your eye on.</p>

    <title>5 Former Design Trends That Aren’t Cool Anymore (So Stop Using Them)</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="5-Former-Design-Trends-That-Aren’t-Cool-Anymore-So-Stop-Using-Them"><a href="#5-Former-Design-Trends-That-Aren’t-Cool-Anymore-So-Stop-Using-Them" class="headerlink" title="5 Former Design Trends That Aren’t Cool Anymore (So Stop Using Them)"></a>5 Former Design Trends That Aren’t Cool Anymore (So Stop Using Them)</h2><p>If you’re like me, looking at your own design work from a few years ago can often result in some laughable or even cringe-worthy moments. Design styles have been steadily evolving and most of us can’t help but be affected by these changes. Who among us hasn’t piled on the cheesy Photoshop layer effects, all the while thinking the result was downright awesome?</p>
<p>However, some of us are a little slower to evolve than others. Today we’ll be taking a walk down memory lane and looking at five design trends that used to be super cool, but now simply tend to make your design look outdated and even ugly. If you’re currently still stuck on these trends, it might be time to move along! We’ll help you out with some modern alternative practices that you can use to bring your design skills into the current year in a hurry.</p>
<h2 id="Let’s-Make-Fun-of-Design"><a href="#Let’s-Make-Fun-of-Design" class="headerlink" title="Let’s Make Fun of Design"></a>Let’s Make Fun of Design</h2><p>We designers tend to take ourselves far too seriously. A post like this could easily lead to derogatory finger pointing and superiority complexes, but let’s go ahead and admit up front that we’ve all flirted with at least a few of these trends, many of us have jumped on board every single one of them.</p>
<p>The only way to escape this fact is to be a new designer, then all you’re doing is jumping on the trends of today. Don’t worry, you won’t regret or perhaps even acknowledge these decisions for at least another three to five years.</p>
<h3 id="What-Are-Design-Trends-Good-For"><a href="#What-Are-Design-Trends-Good-For" class="headerlink" title="What Are Design Trends Good For?"></a>What Are Design Trends Good For?</h3><p>The key to analyzing design trends is to remember that they aren’t inherently good or bad. Instead, they merely serve as a way to observe and remember the collective tastes of bygone eras.</p>
<p>By examining which design practices seem out of style and dated, you can avoid being that guy who still wears tie dye t-shirts on a first date.</p>
<p>In this way, they’re a fantastic history lesson on how styles have evolved over the years. Try to think of past design trends like fashion, something that was cool when you are young will eventually become deplorable, but don’t worry, by the time you’re old it’ll probably see a resurgence.</p>
<p>The practical lesson here is that by examining which design practices seem out of style and dated, you can avoid being that guy who still wears tie dye t-shirts on a first date. Is it the case that you should absolutely abandon all of the practices on this list forever? Absolutely not. Just like with that tie dye shirt, you can probably find a time or two where these seem appropriate, even if only ironically. And who knows? They could come back and become cool again before long!</p>
<h2 id="Bevel-and-Emboss"><a href="#Bevel-and-Emboss" class="headerlink" title="Bevel and Emboss"></a>Bevel and Emboss</h2><p>I know it’s tempting. You open up that Photoshop Effects window and_Bevel and Emboss_is like a siren calling from the rocks, pleading with you to add a touch of realism to your design. Before you know it, you’re staring at something like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/IZ7FVb3.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>There’s almost nothing that screams late 90s/early 2000s design like a good old bevel treatment. We went crazy with these things and put them on everything we touched. Even beloved, age old brand logos weren’t safe from the far reaching effects of this trend.</p>
<p>Like that picture of you on Facebook with the skinny jeans, we now look back on this trend with a “what was I thinking?” attitude. Don’t knockout it though, you’ll do the exact same thing in ten years to whatever you’re working on today!</p>
<h3 id="Do-This-Instead"><a href="#Do-This-Instead" class="headerlink" title="Do This Instead"></a>Do This Instead</h3><p>These days the trend across the board is much more minimalistic that it was ten years ago. We’ve gone past faux realistic bevels and, for the most part, dropped them completely. Now objects tend to have simple, uniform edges with almost no effects apart from the occasional subtle shadow.<a href="http://adrians.info/" target="_blank" rel="external">The World of Adrian Le Bas</a>is a prime example:</p>
<p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/aMnEvmA.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="Web-2-0-Gloss"><a href="#Web-2-0-Gloss" class="headerlink" title="Web 2.0 Gloss"></a>Web 2.0 Gloss</h2><p>The bevel and emboss trend wasn’t suddenly abandoned one day in favor of minimalism. Instead, it had to evolve into something even more ornate before we decided to run in the completely opposite direction.</p>
<p>Bevels alone tend to give an almost clay-like look to an object. Add in some shine though and you’ve suddenly got some fancy plastic and glass effects:</p>
<p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/7vQB32Q.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>This one still hasn’t effectively been killed off, you need not travel far to find its influences. I’ll even gloss up a button or two myself from time to time, though certainly not to this extreme. The problem is of course that stylistically, designers have largely dropped this and are moving once again towards more subtle choices. Implementing a heavily glossed web 2.0 style on your site is a surefire way to make a brand new site seem like it’s already due for a design refresh.</p>
<h3 id="Do-This-Instead-1"><a href="#Do-This-Instead-1" class="headerlink" title="Do This Instead"></a>Do This Instead</h3><p>The good news is that “attractive” buttons are even easier to make these days. All you need is a little border-radius and a slight drop-shadow or gradient. The effect is a nice button style that stands out without being too flashy. Check out this example from<a href="http://www.shopify.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Shopify</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/eYfumqq.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>It’s interesting to note how technology affects design trends. The Photoshop-centric effects of yesterday are giving way to CSS3 styles of today. You can expect this to continue as new possibilities come to light with pure code-driven design.</p>
<h2 id="Lots-of-Cursive-Text"><a href="#Lots-of-Cursive-Text" class="headerlink" title="Lots of Cursive Text"></a>Lots of Cursive Text</h2><p><img src="http://img1.tuicool.com/JRVZR3a.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>This one is a possible exception to my earlier statement about design trends being neither good nor bad from a purely objective standpoint. If a trend actually stands in the way of the success of a design, then it’s easy to argue that it is in fact an example of “bad” design.</p>
<p>I find this to be the case with big blocks of cursive text. For some reason, this is a trend that simply refuses to die. Following this trend is a double whammy of ugly design. Not only does it make your site uncomfortable to browse and read through, it also tends to reflect many of the typeface woes of the 1990s. If there’s one thing you_don’t_currently want someone to say about your site, it’s that it looks like something from when developers with no real design experience were first beginning to apply basic styles to websites.</p>
<h3 id="Do-This-Instead-2"><a href="#Do-This-Instead-2" class="headerlink" title="Do This Instead"></a>Do This Instead</h3><p>Instead of hitting your visitors over the head with overuse of that fancy typeface that you found free online, try instead sprinkling it in extremely selectively. Elementary school taught you that cursive is for professional communication; they lied. In design it should be used very selectively as an occasional accent to more readable alternatives.</p>
<p>There are dozens of<a href="https://designshack.net/articles/inspiration/100-beautiful-script-brush-calligraphy-fonts/" target="_blank" rel="external">beautiful script and calligraphy fonts</a>that have popped up in recent years from independent artists. The key is to choose one that’s readable, and don’t over-use it!</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/B7bemyB.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="The-Burst"><a href="#The-Burst" class="headerlink" title="The Burst"></a>The Burst</h2><p>This one has roots dating back to the early days of even print design. The burst is a tried and true way to grab your viewer’s attention. It says “hey, here’s some important information!” in a easy to implement and instantly recognizable way. The problem: it’s ugly and makes your design look like a marketing professor threw up on it.</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/Ibi22yj.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>My main problem with this is that it reflects a complete lack of thought and imagination. Instead of considering how to effectively integrate a logical and appropriate break into the design pattern, the designers who use this simply use the very first idea that pops into their heads. It would also be the very first idea of every non-designer as well, making it the most uncreative design element you could possibly use.</p>
<h3 id="Do-This-Instead-3"><a href="#Do-This-Instead-3" class="headerlink" title="Do This Instead"></a>Do This Instead</h3><p>The simple solution here is to put a_tiny bit_more thought into creating an element that fits with your overall design theme but still violates the page enough to grab attention. While there’s nothing worse than an invasive pop-over to promote a sale or discount, putting some thought into a stylish and well-designed solution can work well.<a href="https://www.pixelunion.net/apps/pixelpop/" target="_blank" rel="external">PixelPop</a>is a tool that does this perfectly, with thoughtful design and simple templates.</p>
<p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/NbMRvaQ.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="Retro-Redemption"><a href="#Retro-Redemption" class="headerlink" title="Retro Redemption"></a>Retro Redemption</h3><p>The real key to mastering design trends is to know what they suggest. Don’t implement a certain style just because you feel good about it today, instead analyze what it is that you want to achieve and what will work for and/or against that idea.</p>
<p>For instance, if you’re trying to create a modern e-commerce site that reflects current style choices in web design, you should avoid bursts like they’re an 80s rock-a-mullet. However, if you’re_intentionally_creating a retro look, then suddenly bursts once again become a perfectly legitimate and even attractive choice. Check out the<a href="http://www.tomanddan.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Tom and Dan Show site</a>below to see this idea in action:</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/ayMFzim.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="Dramatic-Drop-Shadows"><a href="#Dramatic-Drop-Shadows" class="headerlink" title="Dramatic Drop Shadows"></a>Dramatic Drop Shadows</h2><p>The story here is the same as that of the bevel. That Photoshop “Drop Shadow” layer style is just begging to be played with. If you start by tweaking the default effect, you’re likely to come up with something like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/ZbYrMf7.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>This shadow is big, soft, has plenty of distance and has a color that contrasts heavily with the background. Unfortunately, the result is a design that instantly reeks of cheesy fake lighting effects.</p>
<h3 id="Do-This-Instead-4"><a href="#Do-This-Instead-4" class="headerlink" title="Do This Instead"></a>Do This Instead</h3><p>There are still a million different popular ways to use drop shadows, the above example simply isn’t one of them. If you like the soft, feathered edge look, try blending the shadow in with the background so that it serves to make the text a tad more realistic without being a major distraction.</p>
<p><img src="http://img1.tuicool.com/aQFrimz.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>Another shadow treatment that’s popular right now harkens back to the days before it was common to use soft shadows. This effect uses a non-feathered drop shadow that has a little bit more of a retro feel.</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/raQNVzU.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>You can take this a step further by layering the shadow with a knock section in between the shadow and the text. Once again, this is leaning towards a refined aged feel.</p>
<p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/zqiMJjA.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The examples above should serve to illustrate the idea that following antiquated trends can in fact have a negative effect on your designs and the impressions they leave on your viewers. Once again, the main principal I’m trying to communicate is<em>intentionality</em>. As long as you know what it is your design style of choice is communicating, and that concept or time period is exactly what you’re going for, then you’re on the right track.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that design trends wouldn’t evolve at all without pioneers that go against what’s currently popular and blaze their own trail. Don’t be too eager to jump onto the overused tricks bandwagon if you’re working on a project that merits some innovative thought. Go your own way and let everyone follow you!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Greatness is hard to define and even harder to attain.</p>
<p>Still, we know greatness when we see it. Sometimes, it’s a<a href="https://madeby.google.com/home" target="_blank" rel="external">brilliant new gadget</a>. Or maybe it’s a book that<a href="https://www.amazon.com/But-What-If-Were-Wrong/dp/0399184139/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8" target="_blank" rel="external">rises above the rest</a>. A football star like Tom Brady, even at 39, is great because of who he is and his<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/feb/05/new-england-patriots-super-bowl-51-champions-atlanta-falcons" target="_blank" rel="external">accomplishments</a>.</p>
<p>When a company stands out, you know because there are certain traits and attributes you can identify, sometimes just by paying closer attention. They are widespread and hard to ignore, You can look for these signs by listening closely to what people say in a meeting or when they banter in the cafeteria or after work.</p>
<p>Here are the signs, in order of importance leading up to the most critical attribute:</p>
<h2 id="1-Everyone-is-having-fun"><a href="#1-Everyone-is-having-fun" class="headerlink" title="1. Everyone is having fun"></a>1. Everyone is having fun</h2><p>This is the ultimate entry-point for greatness. It starts here. It’s just fun to be around companies where everyone knows how to do all of the other things on my list below. You want to be there. You feel encouraged and motivated. It’s a great place to hang out, even after work or on weekends. Fun radiates out of the place, and it is that_allure_that attracts even more talented employees one after the other. Without a sense of fun and creativity, forget ever achieving any level of greatness. To be great, you have to be a beacon.</p>
<h2 id="2-No-one-is-pedantic"><a href="#2-No-one-is-pedantic" class="headerlink" title="2. No one is pedantic"></a>2. No one is pedantic</h2><p>Why am I using such a specific word here? How is it related to great companies? For 26 years, I’ve been involved in multiple organizations and volunteered at many different entities both small and large, and the one thing that seems to kill all progress and creativity is a lack of respect. The sure sign that respect is not common in a company culture is when everyone acts like they know everything. Sure, the mantra “be curious” is important. You can’t be_curious_and_pedantic_at the same time. When the company is filled with people who want to learn new things, it becomes a great place.</p>
<h2 id="3-Empathy-abounds"><a href="#3-Empathy-abounds" class="headerlink" title="3. Empathy abounds"></a>3. Empathy abounds</h2><p>Empathy is an ability to see another point-of-view. When everyone seems to have that ability, look out–that company is going to excel. It’s going to blow the roof off, in fact. We all need each other to help us grow, and empathy is an engine for that. I’m going to help you, you’re going to help me–that’s called<em>teamwork</em>. Sadly, empathy is not that common. Tied closely with that sense of pride and a know-it-all-attitude is a closed mentality that is more about self advancement. I’ve visited hundreds and hundreds of companies, and the one trait that seems to stick out when there’s a bad one is when everyone is trying to advance their own career. Empathy is in short supply, and so is greatness.</p>
<h2 id="4-Expectations-are-crystal-clear-to-everyone"><a href="#4-Expectations-are-crystal-clear-to-everyone" class="headerlink" title="4. Expectations are crystal clear to everyone"></a>4. Expectations are crystal clear to everyone</h2><p>Years ago, I had a boss who never bothered to explain what we were doing or why. Then, he became critical when we didn’t do what he wanted. Huh? Every employee was shooting in the dark with a pop gun. We didn’t know where to aim, when to shoot, or why we were even in the room. As humans, we all want to know<em>why</em>–what’s the vision here? Where are we even going? Why are we doing these things? If that’s crystal clear, then it creates a great company because the entire organization becomes unified. Even more importantly, the goals are clear to everyone involved. It’s not a well-kept secret.</p>
<h2 id="5-Grace-is-prevalent"><a href="#5-Grace-is-prevalent" class="headerlink" title="5. Grace is prevalent"></a>5. Grace is prevalent</h2><p>What happens when employees miss their goals? What if you know where you’re going as an organization but you don’t quite end up getting there in the end? This is where grace is important. I’m convinced that showing grace instead of a demeaning, belittling attitude is what makes a company even greater. I’ll say it’s even more important than having fun. Why is that? Because grace is a license to fail, and being free to try new things and fail at times is what makes people work hard and want to stick around. A culture of criticism kills momentum. A culture of grace, encouragement, understanding, and excitement will turn any organization into a<em>giant</em>.</p>
<h2 id="6-Roles-are-clearly-defined"><a href="#6-Roles-are-clearly-defined" class="headerlink" title="6. Roles are clearly defined"></a>6. Roles are clearly defined</h2><p>“I never know what I’m doing” is a tough predicament for any employee. Employees feel anxious and awkward. You have to set expectations about the<em>why</em>. However, even more important as a starting point for greatness is the idea of role definition. Employee need to feel empowered, and that’s where clear roles come into play. A role is a reason. It’s a way to define why that employee is even at the company and the scope of their involvement. You can’t make expectations until you have informed the employee about how much power he or she can wield. Then, set them loose. Greatness will happen.</p>
<h2 id="7-Everyone-sees-and-rewards-hard-work"><a href="#7-Everyone-sees-and-rewards-hard-work" class="headerlink" title="7. Everyone sees and rewards hard work"></a>7. Everyone sees and rewards hard work</h2><p>I’ve been involved with companies that really know how to recognize employees. On Slack, they’re praising each other all day–in a real way that shows true pride in the accomplishments of others. We communicated! We discussed! We resolved! It’s a team exercise writ large (and in digital form), one that involves frequent pats on the back when there’s a milestone. It’s crazy to think some companies don’t do this. They only acknowledge hard work in rare instances. Most of the time, they are treating employees like cattle that need to be herded–and kicked if they get out of line.</p>
<h2 id="8-Every-employee-is-happy"><a href="#8-Every-employee-is-happy" class="headerlink" title="8. Every employee is happy"></a>8. Every employee is happy</h2><p>Here’s a great way to define happiness at work: An employee is happy when they are perfectly suited to their role. They are challenged enough, placed into the proper department, encouraged constantly to achieve great things, and know their expectations. A happy group of employees creates a dynamic environment. An unhappy group causes constant conflict and stress, which makes the company sink like a stone.</p>
<h2 id="9-Mentoring-is-more-important-than-performance"><a href="#9-Mentoring-is-more-important-than-performance" class="headerlink" title="9. Mentoring is more important than performance"></a>9. Mentoring is more important than performance</h2><p>You know, most of us will figure it out and do great work. Beaten into submission by an angry boss won’t work. Mentoring will. I wanted to list this one as the most important attribute of a great company, but it does fall into second place. (Only a great leader can mentor effectively, so that has to be number one.) Yet, it’s so critical. It’s a way to hand down tacit knowledge. Great companies know how to do that. Great employees know how to mentor one another. They are highly motivated to train others because they know that’s what creates greatness. In fact, that’s really the definition to remember: A great company is one where the most important knowledge is handed down from one employee to the next in a way that’s built on the foundation of<em>individual relationships</em>.</p>
<h2 id="10-There’s-a-great-leader"><a href="#10-There’s-a-great-leader" class="headerlink" title="10. There’s a great leader"></a>10. There’s a great leader</h2><p>I’ve written about this before, but behind every great company there is a great leader. Call it the trickle-down effect of management. Someone at the top practices all of the attributes listed above and demonstrates what it means to show empathy, recognize hard work, and promote mentoring. Greatness happens. A great leader has an attitude that generates enthusiasm and happiness among the staff. It’s contagious.</p>

We are aware that the listed<a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/vpn/best-gaming-vpn/" target="_blank" rel="external">games</a>were supported on both iOS and Android. In fact, we have yet to come across<a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/android/best-shooter-games-for-android/" target="_blank" rel="external">Android</a>exclusive titles. So that opens a discussion about all the games that have come out on iOS that are playable offline. However, we recommend you check out our Android list after you’re done with this, it lists exceptional offline<a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/android/the-best-android-games-of-2017/" target="_blank" rel="external">games</a>that came out on iOS first and are definitely worth checking out.

<p>If you remember the choose your own adventure genre of books, Device 6 will seem familiar to you. Since page turning on a tablet is purely an affectation, the multiple award winning (including the coveted Apple Design Award) Device 6 takes it to the next conclusion. The game is a story about solving puzzles and finding your way through a series of choices. Some of those choices will lead to dead-ends and some of those choices will make the story progress.</p>
<p>Each new arc will either ask you to change your device’s orientation to read further, or will require you to scroll back to pick up sounds or other clues. There are no loading screens, no need for saves, it is a linear game with branching arcs. This is a must have for all iOS owners, even if they are not gamers, because it is a first of its kind genre defining game.</p>

<p>This is the game that took Telltale series form an obscure developer to a mainstream medium for title crossovers. Even though their preliminary focus remains on comic and fantasy crossovers today, their biggest foray was bringing back Monkey Island for the modern generation. The episodic concept was not even mainstream at the time. Telltale told the story of Guybrush Threepwood attempting to save himself from becoming a Zombie while protecting his wife Elaine Marley from the zombie pirate LeChuck. The last sequel of this series came out in the year 2000. If you are not familiar with the property, it is a comedy game (and a hilarious one at that) that focuses on puzzle solving to get through. Highly recommended.</p>

<p>This is one of those Tim Shafer strokes of genius. It originally came out on DOS back in 1993 as a sequel to Maniac Mansion that came out in 1987. In fact, you can even play the original game on an old computer. The remastered edition has breathed new life into what was already a timeless classic. The game is a comedy about a sentient tentacle who drinks radioactive water and becomes evil. Our main characters are a loony scientist who created the tentacle and three kids who end up in different eras in time.</p>
<p>You meet the founding fathers of the United States and you are thrust into a totalitarian future where the tentacles rule and humans are treated as pets. Day of The Tentacle is about restoring the timeline and order in the world. Every single puzzle is intriguing, the story is both engrossing and funny, and it is an experience every gamer needs to have at least once in their lives.</p>

<p>This first person adventure game comes from Simogo AB, the people behind Device 6. The game takes the Swedish lore of timewalking and turns it into the core mechanic. Set in the 19th century, the game relies on you to solve puzzles by touching them and seeing a glimpse of the future. The storyline is very immersive and you will be lost in all the creepy detail and atmosphere. The game, much like Device 6, is a bold step that seems to have paid off. It is a fantastic looking game that is both fun to play and immersive to experience.</p>

<p>The success of Minecraft is extraordinary. With a constantly expanding canvas that has now grown larger in size than the planet Neptune, it attracts players from all over the world to build structures out of blocks. If you are not familiar with the property, it is like playing with LEGOs on a computer, with the caveat that you never run out of blocks and you can do practically anything you want. People have recreated entire cities accurately scaled to the last detail, people have created bots (called engineers) to help create large structures for them. Even companies like Verizon have created cell networks within the game, where you can browse the internet and even make video calls (which is a feat of computer engineering on its own, check that out<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdlZRhKmWJY&amp;ab_channel=CaptainSparklez" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>).</p>
<p>If you are interested in creating objects, then this THE game for you. The pocket edition lets you play the game using the touchscreen and gives you the same access as any other platform.</p>

<p>This game originally came out in 1999 and has become a signature series since. Originally it was published by 3DO, now by Ubisoft (They’re up to the VII installment now). It is a turn based strategy game that puts you in the fictional world of fantasy creatures. You choose between mythical factions to strategically wage war against others. An army sent from the divine heavens could be put to fight against the armies of hell. Or you could pit orcs and goblins against elves and dragons. Genies vs Vampires, the list goes on.</p>

<p>The game is a turn-based strategy game. You send a hero out into the world to explore, fight creatures, unearth hidden and protected treasures, and defeat other heroes to become the last player standing. There is a fantastic story mode that takes you to all the realms in the game and a hot seat multiplayer mode that lets as many as 8 players take turns on the same machine. The HD remake keeps all the elements of the original release, only with updated visuals. The original game is played completely using a mouse pointer, which makes touch the ideal evolutionary platform for it.</p>

<p>You are a prisoner in a maximum security facility. Your mission is to escape. You do so by first learning the prison routine. You then craft items that will eventually help you find your way out of the prison. The concept is very simple, yet also very intriguing. It borrows numerous parts of different games like Minecraft and stealth games and combines them to help you escape from the confines of prison.</p>

<p>The LEGO series of games is a widespread genre from simple construction games to complex storylines with mainstream characters. There are crossovers from DC, Marvel, Star Wars, Harry Potter, and numerous others. The games bring a new light to already established properties. There is a fantastic storyline exclusive to the LEGO World. You can replay your favourite moments from franchises like Harry Potter and Star Wars with a LEGO twist, you can patrol Metropolis as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman or Green Lantern, it’s all possible. On top of all that, the games are genuinely fun without being silly. There is campy humor sprinkled here and there, but the games themselves are very true to the source material.</p>

Oceanhorn – Monster of Uncharted Seas</h3><p>Oceanhorn, by the developer’s own admission, is the iOS equivalent of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild the insanely popular title by Nintendo making the rounds on Nintendo Switch and Wii devices. However, Oceanhorn isn’t a cheap attempt at capitalizing on another title’s success, it is thematically close to The Wind Walker.</p>
<p>It is a beautifully crafted game with extremely stunning visuals that truly milk the GPU in your iOS device (especially the iPhone 7/7 Plus). The story is well crafted, the sound is well designed. It is actually a good game on its own merits and should definitely be tried out especially if you are a fan of the Zelda games.</p>

<p>This game will remind of you Lara Craft Go at first glance, because of the eerily similar visuals. However, if you treat it as a standalone title, you will be pleasantly surprised at just how good this game is. The game focuses on both visuals and some interesting puzzles to solve. Games like these are fun to play, as they can be played any time without requiring too much attention while still being entertaining.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Mac App Store and the iTunes App Store both ask for your password when you download an app. You will be asked to enter your Apple ID password regardless if you’re buying an app or downloading a free one. This is done in part to prevent unauthorized purchases. It’s also a good deterrent for when the kids go wild on the App Store. The only problem is that it can get annoying. If you don’t want to enter your password for free app downloads, you can save it. Likewise, if you’re regretting this decision, you can remove your Apple ID password for free purchases. Here’s how you can store or remove your Apple ID password for free purchases in macOS.</p>
<h3 id="Store-Apple-ID-Password-For-Free-Purchases"><a href="#Store-Apple-ID-Password-For-Free-Purchases" class="headerlink" title="Store Apple ID Password For Free Purchases"></a>Store Apple ID Password For Free Purchases</h3><p>There are two ways to go about this. One, open the Mac App Store app and look for a free app. Click the ‘Get’ button and enter your Apple ID password when prompted.</p>
<p>The Mac App Store app will prompt you to save your password for future free purchases. It’s very much like your browser asking to store login credentials for a website.</p>
<p>When you see the ‘Save Password for Free Items’ prompt, click ‘Yes’.</p>

<p>If the prompt doesn’t appear, you can use the second method.</p>
<p>Open the System Preferences app. Click the App Store preference. At the very bottom is an option called ‘Free Downloads’. Open the drop-down next to it and select ‘Save Password’. macOS might prompt you to enter your Apple ID password. This will not affect paid app downloads. You will still be asked to enter your password when you buy an app.</p>

<h3 id="Remove-Apple-ID-Password-For-Free-Purchases"><a href="#Remove-Apple-ID-Password-For-Free-Purchases" class="headerlink" title="Remove Apple ID Password For Free Purchases"></a>Remove Apple ID Password For Free Purchases</h3><p>Open System Preferences and select ‘App Store’. At the bottom of this preference pane open the Free Downloads drop-down. Select the ‘Require Password’ option. The next time you download a free app from the Mac App Store, you will have to enter you Apple ID password.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/mac-os/apple-id-password-for-free-purchases-macos/attachment/remove-app-store-password-for-free-apps/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://cloud.addictivetips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/remove-app-store-password-for-free-apps.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>This option has its pros and cons. The pro here is that you don’t need to verify your identity when you download a free app. A free app, by and large, will not create a problem for you. The con is that even free apps can be problematic in terms of content. If you don’t want to save your Apple ID password for free apps to protect minors who might use your Mac, consider using parental controls instead of removing your Apple ID password.</p>
