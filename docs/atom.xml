    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the front-end community, there is a lot of attention related to documenting JavaScript. That’s not so much the case with CSS. Often times I feel like lost when I join a project with minimal or no CSS documentation.</p>
<p>Even though CSS is relatively easy to write, it can be quite hard to maintain.The specificity, the global scope of everything, and the lack of guidance can easily lead to inconsistency, code duplication, and over-complication.</p>
<p>I’ve long been curious what a really well-documented CSS codebase looks like. Here, I’ll share my experience, along with the expectations I have towards my vision of well-documented stylesheets.</p>
<p>It surprises me where I hear people say that commenting CSS is not that important. I imagine none of them have had to deal with 10,000+ line stylesheets! Often I’ve struggled with what HTML results in what specific style. Without having a solid context about the development decisions taken, debugging efforts increase.<a href="http://commadot.com/wtf-per-minute/" target="_blank" rel="external">WTFs per minute</a>increase exponentially too.</p>
<p>Many times I’ve spent hours to figure out what the developer intended, why she didn’t do it the another way, why is this layout seemingly so complex. There is much pain buried in these “why” questions.</p>
<p>So, here we go! Let’s examine the 4 big signs of a well-documented CSS codebase.</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/mE3YfiU.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="1-CSS-Tech-Stack-amp-Toolchain"><a href="#1-CSS-Tech-Stack-amp-Toolchain" class="headerlink" title="1) CSS Tech Stack &amp; Toolchain"></a>1) CSS Tech Stack &amp; Toolchain</h3><p>There are likely things as part of our CSS code base like third-party libraries, mixins, or other tools. Looking in the package manager’s dependencies list doesn’t give a lot of context_why_the decisions were made to add these things, what they do exactly, and how we’re using them.</p>
<p>It would be good for everyone to know why a certain library or tool was introduced. Imagine, for example, that a third-party library was introduced only to solve what has become an obsolete CSS issue. If we had context like that, we could make more informed decisions.</p>
<p>There sometimes can be quite a few third-party libraries in a project. Have you ever spent a bunch of time on web searching each one figuring out what it even is? It can be quite a challenge to know or to keep track of what each exactly does.</p>
<p>A well-documented codebase would include a description for each dependency. Perhaps you could the comment tweet-length (140 characters) explaining why it is there. That would give anyone else in the code base a head start on why something is there.</p>
<p>I like adding these descriptions right in the place where I<code>@import</code>them.</p>
<h3 id="2-CSS-Conventions"><a href="#2-CSS-Conventions" class="headerlink" title="2) CSS Conventions"></a>2) CSS Conventions</h3><p>Good coding conventions result in consistent, readable, and unambiguous source code. They standardize the structure and coding style of an application so that you and others can easily read and understand the code.</p>
<p>It’s important to know if there are any project-specific naming conventions or methodologies in place (likeBEM,<a href="https://css-tricks.com/on-style-maintenance/#article-header-id-2" target="_blank" rel="external">OOCSS</a>,<a href="https://smacss.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">SMACSS</a>, orACSS). I’ve seen cases where a certain methodologies principles are applied but<a href="https://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/" target="_blank" rel="external">the actual rules followed are modified based on the preferences of the developers involved</a>. So an indication how strictly we must follow the methodology principles would be good to leave in a well-documented code base.</p>
<p>This brings up the larger issue of CSS style guides. A naming convention is just one choice as part of a complete styling strategy. Other parts might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>How is code sectioned?</li>
<li>How are files structured?</li>
<li><a href="https://css-tricks.com/poll-results-how-do-you-order-your-css-properties/" target="_blank" rel="external">How are properties ordered?</a></li>
<li>How is commenting done?</li>
<li>How is the formatting done (indentation, rule declarations)?</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/airbnb/css#javascript-hooks" target="_blank" rel="external">How to bind JavaScript hooks to classes?</a></li>
<li>… and many more rules or anti-patterns like nesting more then 3 levels deep, avoiding ID selectors,<br><a href="https://css-tricks.com/when-using-important-is-the-right-choice/" target="_blank" rel="external">using !important only for utility classes</a><br>and etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>All this makes up a completeCSS style guide. Having a shared vocabulary like this I’d consider a strong plus towards consistency.</p>
<h3 id="3-CSS-Architecture"><a href="#3-CSS-Architecture" class="headerlink" title="3) CSS Architecture"></a>3) CSS Architecture</h3><p>Most scalable projects follow some type of architecture in terms of ordering styles. In a well-documented codebase, the fundamental principles that the project follows when structuring and sectioning styles should be mentioned.</p>
<p>I was first inspired to explore CSS architecture by<a href="https://youtu.be/1OKZOV-iLj4" target="_blank" rel="external">watching Harry Roberts’s talk about managing CSS projects</a>. Here’s Harry:</p>
<p>CSS architecture seems to be somewhat in vogue right now. It’s something you’ve no doubt heard mentioned numerous times over the past year or so, and with good reason: UIs (and the teams that build them) are getting bigger and more complicated than ever before.</p>
<p>There are a number of aspects of CSS which make it troublesome. It’s declarative, meaning there is no logic or control flow to tell other developers much about the state or construction of the project. It operates in a global namespace, meaning we get collisions, leaking styles and inadvertent regressions. It utilizes inheritance, making everything somewhat interdependent and brittle. Finally, the unavoidable specificity model can cause problems when selectors fight each other for prominence.</p>
<p>Therefore, he<a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/manage-large-css-projects-itcss-101517528" target="_blank" rel="external">introduces a concept for architecting CSS called ITCSS</a>. If you are working on a project of reasonable scale, chances are someone already defined similar principles or ideas that aim to resolve these problems. So in a well-documented codebase, I would expect to see them written somewhere.</p>
<p>One could tell if the architecture is explained well enough if you can answer the following question: Where should new styles or stylesheets be added?</p>
<h3 id="4-CSS-Component-Descriptions-and-Examples"><a href="#4-CSS-Component-Descriptions-and-Examples" class="headerlink" title="4) CSS Component Descriptions and Examples"></a>4) CSS Component Descriptions and Examples</h3><p>A common pattern is to separate the logical modules into CSS components (or “blocks” according to BEM). Some of them might be re-usable, some may not, but the important thing is that they are the building blocks of our project. Therefore, describing what they are should be a top priority in a well-documented codebase.</p>
<p>Ideally, you should arrange and group them, name them, and establish rules between them to generate an overview of all components. A well-described CSS component doesn’t only include information about what the component does but also has other valuable intel like example HTML markup and the context in which it’s meant to be used. Going one step further brings up the issue of<a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/taking-pattern-libraries-next-level/" target="_blank" rel="external">Pattern Libraries</a>. A pattern library is a collection of reusable components that can be used together to create a website. With modular, component-based architecture becoming a trend, they can bring huge value.</p>
<p>The goal of a pattern library is to show what can be built with existing patterns (components). But let’s take a look at what additional information can be displayed alongside each pattern also. Vitaly Friedman shared a good summary on<a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/taking-pattern-libraries-next-level/" target="_blank" rel="external">how taking the pattern library to the next level looks like</a>. He states that focusing on components isn’t good enough:</p>
<p>One of the main problems with pattern libraries is that, while they provide an overview of components, they often leave a lot open to interpretation. Components can be combined in a variety of ways, consistently and inconsistently. It’s great to be able to see what button variants and iconography are available and what kinds of tables and pricing tags one may use, but what if you need to design or build an interface that contains all of these components at once — and perhaps another that doesn’t yet exist in the library?</p>
<p>A list of modules alone wouldn’t convey any context or any specifics on how the modules should (and should not) be used.</p>
<p>Based on Vitaly’s post and<a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/anatomy-of-a-pattern-in-a-pattern-library/" target="_blank" rel="external">Brad Frost’s anatomy of a pattern in a pattern library</a>, here are a few ideas I can imagine each of our patterns (components) could have, despite the usual unique name, code sample and a description of the component’s purpose. Basic (fundamental):</p>
<ul>
<li>Tags or categories: The assigned tags or categories for the component. Developers could tag their components with “in use”, “needs refactoring” tags and etc.</li>
<li>Responsive preview: A real-life, resizable preview of the component, using the actual snippet of code being used in production. Alternatively, just a screenshot.</li>
<li>Versioning and legacy, team members involved or responsible: In a bigger team, the ownership of the (family of) components and which team members have been actively developing them could be really helpful for maintenance and further development.</li>
</ul>
<p>… and here are a few more advanced:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance impact: Sometimes CSS could be heavy too. An indicator of performance or a “warning signs” section, outlining not only performance impact but also any common mishaps when the pattern is used incorrectly.</li>
<li>Accessibility implications: Indicator of accessibility requirements. Some components might require more work to maintain accessibility, especially if they interact with other components.</li>
<li>Related patterns: A quick overview of related components or the family of components that a given component belongs to. Could use an explanation of when to use a component, when not to, and why.</li>
<li>Fallback and print previews.</li>
</ul>
<p>… the list goes on and on to whatever makes sense for your specific use-case.</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>A well-documented CSS codebase enforces consistency, boosts maintainability, and helps the team to build a shared vocabulary. It is a prerequisite for efficient CSS design and development. Moreover, based on my experience, it inevitably leads to better performance. I strongly believe that these are the signs of the professional execution of a project.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Understanding JavaScript and its potential impact on search performance is a core skillset of the modern SEO professional. If search engines can’t crawl a site or can’t parse and understand the content, nothing is going to get indexed and the site is not going to rank.</p>
<p>The most important questions for an SEO relating to JavaScript: Can search engines see the content and grasp the website experience? If not, what solutions can be leveraged to fix this?</p>
<h2 id="Fundamentals"><a href="#Fundamentals" class="headerlink" title="Fundamentals"></a>Fundamentals</h2><h3 id="What-is-JavaScript"><a href="#What-is-JavaScript" class="headerlink" title="What is JavaScript?"></a>What is JavaScript?</h3><p>When creating a modern web page, there are three major components:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>HTML –</strong><br>Hypertext Markup Language serves as the backbone, or organizer of content, on a site. It is the structure of the website (e.g. headings, paragraphs, list elements, etc.) and defining static content.</li>
<li><strong>CSS –</strong><br>Cascading Style Sheets are the design, glitz, glam, and style added to a website. It makes up the presentation layer of the page.</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript –</strong><br>JavaScript is the interactivity and a core component of the dynamic web.</li>

<p>JavaScript is either placed in the HTML document within &lt;script&gt; tags (i.e., it is embedded in the HTML) or linked/referenced. There are currently a plethora of JavaScript libraries and frameworks, including jQuery, AngularJS, ReactJS, EmberJS, etc.</p>
<h4 id="JavaScript-libraries-and-frameworks"><a href="#JavaScript-libraries-and-frameworks" class="headerlink" title="JavaScript libraries and frameworks:"></a>JavaScript libraries and frameworks:</h4><p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/Q73aYj2.png!web" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="What-is-AJAX"><a href="#What-is-AJAX" class="headerlink" title="What is AJAX?"></a>What is AJAX?</h3><p>AJAX, or Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, is a set of web development techniques combining JavaScript and XML that allows web applications to communicate with a server in the background without interfering with the current page. Asynchronous means that other functions or lines of code can run while the_async_script is running. XML used to be the primary language to pass data; however, the term AJAX is used for all types of data transfers (including JSON; I guess “AJAJ” doesn’t sound as clean as “AJAX” [pun intended]).</p>
<p>A common use of AJAX is to update the content or layout of a webpage without initiating a full page refresh. Normally, when a page loads, all the assets on the page must be requested and fetched from the server and then rendered on the page. However, with AJAX, only the assets that differ between pages need to be loaded, which improves the user experience as they do not have to refresh the entire page.</p>
<p>One can think of AJAX as mini server calls. A good example of AJAX in action is Google Maps. The page updates without a full page reload (i.e., mini server calls are being used to load content as the user navigates).</p>

<h3 id="What-is-the-Document-Object-Model-DOM"><a href="#What-is-the-Document-Object-Model-DOM" class="headerlink" title="What is the Document Object Model (DOM)?"></a>What is the Document Object Model (DOM)?</h3><p>As an SEO professional, you need to understand what the DOM is, because it’s what Google is using to analyze and understand webpages.</p>
<p>The DOM is what you see when you “Inspect Element” in a browser. Simply put, you can think of the DOM as the steps the browser takes after receiving the HTML document to render the page.</p>
<p>The first thing the browser receives is the HTML document. After that, it will start parsing the content within this document and fetch additional resources, such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files.</p>
<p>The DOM is what forms from this parsing of information and resources. One can think of it as a structured, organized version of the webpage’s code.</p>
<p>Nowadays the DOM is often very different from the initial HTML document, due to what’s collectively called<em>dynamic HTML</em>. Dynamic HTML is the ability for a page to change its content depending on user input, environmental conditions (e.g. time of day), and other variables, leveraging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
<p>Simple example with a &lt;title&gt; tag that is populated through JavaScript:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left">HTML source</th>
<th style="text-align:left">DOM</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/QBJ3qeM.png!web" alt=""></td>
<td style="text-align:left"><img src="http://img1.tuicool.com/fmaimmr.png!web" alt=""></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3 id="What-is-headless-browsing"><a href="#What-is-headless-browsing" class="headerlink" title="What is headless browsing?"></a>What is headless browsing?</h3><p>Headless browsing is simply the action of fetching webpages without the user interface. It is important to understand because Google,<a href="https://www.merkleinc.com/blog/baidu-adds-new-spider-rendering-job" target="_blank" rel="external">and now Baidu</a>, leverage headless browsing to gain a better understanding of the user’s experience and the content of webpages.</p>
<p><a href="http://phantomjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">PhantomJS</a>and<a href="http://zombie.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Zombie.js</a>are scripted headless browsers, typically used for automating web interaction for testing purposes, and rendering static HTML snapshots for initial requests (pre-rendering).</p>
<h2 id="Why-can-JavaScript-be-challenging-for-SEO-and-how-to-fix-issues"><a href="#Why-can-JavaScript-be-challenging-for-SEO-and-how-to-fix-issues" class="headerlink" title="Why can JavaScript be challenging for SEO? (and how to fix issues)"></a>Why can JavaScript be challenging for SEO? (and how to fix issues)</h2><p>There are three (3) primary reasons to be concerned about JavaScript on your site:</p>
<ol>
<li>Crawlability: Bots’ ability to crawl your site.</li>
<li>Obtainability: Bots’ ability to access information and parse your content.</li>
<li>Perceived site latency: AKA the Critical Rendering Path.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/bAVB7bI.png!web" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="Crawlability"><a href="#Crawlability" class="headerlink" title="Crawlability"></a>Crawlability</h3><p>Are bots able to find URLs and understand your site’s architecture? There are two important elements here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Blocking search engines from your JavaScript (even accidentally).</li>
<li>Proper internal linking, not leveraging JavaScript events as a replacement for HTML tags.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="Why-is-blocking-JavaScript-such-a-big-deal"><a href="#Why-is-blocking-JavaScript-such-a-big-deal" class="headerlink" title="Why is blocking JavaScript such a big deal?"></a>Why is blocking JavaScript such a big deal?</h4><p>If search engines are<a href="https://moz.com/blog/why-all-seos-should-unblock-js-css" target="_blank" rel="external">blocked from crawling JavaScript</a>, they will not be receiving your site’s full experience. This means search engines are not seeing what the end user is seeing. This can reduce your site’s appeal to search engines and could eventually be considered cloaking (if the intent is indeed malicious).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/googlebot-fetch" target="_blank" rel="external">Fetch as Google</a>and TechnicalSEO.com’s<a href="https://technicalseo.com/seo-tools/robots-txt/" target="_blank" rel="external">robots.txt</a>and<a href="https://technicalseo.com/seo-tools/fetch-render/" target="_blank" rel="external">Fetch and Render</a>testing tools can help to identify resources that Googlebot is blocked from.</p>
<p>The easiest way to solve this problem is through providing search engines access to the resources they need to understand your user experience.</p>
<p>_!!! Important note:_Work with your development team to determine which files should and should not be accessible to search engines.</p>
<h4 id="Internal-linking"><a href="#Internal-linking" class="headerlink" title="Internal linking"></a>Internal linking</h4><p>Internal linking should be implemented with regular anchor tags within the HTML or the DOM (using an<a href="https://moz.com/blog/www.example.com" target="_blank" rel="external">HTML tag) versus leveraging JavaScript functions to allow the user to traverse the site.</a></p>
<p>Essentially: Don’t use JavaScript’s onclick events as a replacement for internal linking. While end URLs might be found and crawled (through strings in JavaScript code or XML sitemaps), they won’t be associated with the global navigation of the site.</p>
<p>Internal linking is a strong signal to search engines regarding the site’s architecture and importance of pages. In fact, internal links are so strong that they can (in certain situations) override “SEO hints” such as canonical tags.</p>
<h4 id="URL-structure"><a href="#URL-structure" class="headerlink" title="URL structure"></a>URL structure</h4><p>Historically, JavaScript-based websites (aka “AJAX sites”) were using fragment identifiers (#) within URLs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Not recommended:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>The Lone Hash (#) –</strong><br>The lone pound symbol is not crawlable. It is used to identify anchor link (aka jump links). These are the links that allow one to jump to a piece of content on a page. Anything after the lone hash portion of the URL is never sent to the server and will cause the page to automatically scroll to the first element with a matching ID (or the first<br>&lt;<br>a<br>&gt;<br> element with a name of the following information).<br><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+JohnMueller/posts/LT4fU7kFB8W" target="_blank" rel="external">Google recommends</a><br>avoiding the use of “#“ in URLs.</li>
<li><strong>Hashbang (#!) (and</strong><br><a href="https://developers.google.com/webmasters/ajax-crawling/docs/specification" target="_blank" rel="external"><strong>escaped_fragments</strong></a><br><strong>URLs) –</strong><br>Hashbang URLs were a hack to support crawlers (Google wants to avoid now and only Bing supports). Many a moon ago, Google and Bing developed a complicated AJAX solution, whereby a pretty (#!) URL with the UX co-existed with an equivalent escaped_fragment HTML-based experience for bots. Google has since backtracked on this recommendation, preferring to receive the exact user experience. In escaped fragments, there are two experiences here:<ul>
<li><strong>Original Experience (aka Pretty URL):</strong><br>This URL must either have a #! (hashbang) within the URL to indicate that there is an escaped fragment or a meta element indicating that an escaped fragment exists (<br>&lt;<br>meta name=”fragment” content=”!”<br>&gt;<br>).</li>
<li><strong>Escaped Fragment (aka Ugly URL, HTML snapshot):</strong><br>This URL replace the hashbang (#!) with “_escaped_fragment_” and serves the HTML snapshot. It is called the ugly URL because it’s long and looks like (and for all intents and purposes is) a hack.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Recommended:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>pushState History API –</strong><br>PushState is navigation-based and part of the History API (think: your web browsing history). Essentially, pushState updates the URL in the address bar and only what needs to change on the page is updated. It allows JS sites to leverage “clean” URLs. PushState is currently<br><a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2016/11/building-indexable-progressive-web-apps.html" target="_blank" rel="external">supported by Google</a><br>, when supporting browser navigation for client-side or hybrid rendering.<ul>
<li>A good use of pushState is for infinite scroll (i.e., as the user hits new parts of the page the URL will update). Ideally, if the user refreshes the page, the experience will land them in the exact same spot. However, they do not need to refresh the page, as the content updates as they scroll down, while the URL is updated in the address bar.</li>
<li>Example: A good example of a search engine-friendly infinite scroll implementation, created by Google’s John Mueller (go figure), can be found<br><a href="http://scrollsample.appspot.com/items" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a><br>. He technically leverages the replaceState(), which doesn’t include the same back button functionality as pushState.</li>

<h3 id="Obtainability"><a href="#Obtainability" class="headerlink" title="Obtainability"></a>Obtainability</h3><p>Search engines have been shown to employ headless browsing to render the DOM to gain a better understanding of the user’s experience and the content on page. That is to say, Google can process some JavaScript and uses the DOM (instead of the HTML document).</p>
<p>At the same time, there are situations where search engines struggle to comprehend JavaScript. Nobody wants<a href="http://www.linkresearchtools.com/case-studies/hulu-javascript-fail-visibility-drop/" target="_blank" rel="external">a Hulu situation</a>to happen to their site or a client’s site. It is crucial to understand how bots are interacting with your onsite content. When you aren’t sure, test.</p>
<p>Assuming we’re talking about a search engine bot that executes JavaScript, there are a few important elements for search engines to be able to obtain content:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the user must interact for something to fire, search engines probably aren’t seeing it.<ul>
<li>Google is a lazy user. It doesn’t click, it doesn’t scroll, and it doesn’t log in. If the full UX demands action from the user, special precautions should be taken to ensure that bots are receiving an equivalent experience.</li>
</ul>
</li>

TEST"></a>1. TEST</h4><p>The most popular solution to resolving JavaScript is probably not resolving anything (grab a coffee and let Google work its algorithmic brilliance). Providing Google with the same experience as searchers is<a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2015/10/deprecating-our-ajax-crawling-scheme.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Google’s preferred scenario</a>.</p>
<p>Google first announced being able to “better understand the web (i.e., JavaScript)” in<a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/05/understanding-web-pages-better.html" target="_blank" rel="external">May 2014</a>. Industry experts suggested that Google could crawl JavaScript way before this announcement. The iPullRank team offered two great pieces on this in 2011:<a href="http://ipullrank.com/googlebot-is-chrome/" target="_blank" rel="external">Googlebot is Chrome</a>and<a href="https://moz.com/blog/just-how-smart-are-search-robots" target="_blank" rel="external">How smart are Googlebots?</a>(thank you, Josh and Mike). Adam Audette’s<a href="http://searchengineland.com/tested-googlebot-crawls-javascript-heres-learned-220157" target="_blank" rel="external">Google can crawl JavaScript and leverages the DOM</a>in 2015 confirmed. Therefore, if you can see your content in the DOM, chances are your content is being parsed by Google.</p>
<p><img src="http://img1.tuicool.com/ZJj6VrV.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>Recently, Barry Goralewicz performed<a href="https://goralewicz.com/blog/javascript-seo-experiment/" target="_blank" rel="external">a cool experiment testing a combination of various JavaScript libraries and frameworks</a>to determine how Google interacts with the pages (e.g., are they indexing URL/content? How does GSC interact? Etc.). It ultimately showed that Google is able to interact with many forms of JavaScript and highlighted certain frameworks as perhaps more challenging.<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/js-sites-wg" target="_blank" rel="external">John Mueller even started a JavaScript search group</a>(from what I’ve read, it’s fairly therapeutic).</p>
<p>All of these studies are amazing and help SEOs understand when to be concerned and take a proactive role. However, before you determine that sitting back is the right solution for your site, I recommend being actively cautious by experimenting with small section Think: Jim Collin’s “bullets, then cannonballs” philosophy from his book<a href="http://www.jimcollins.com/books/great-by-choice.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Great by Choice</a>:</p>
<p>“A bullet is an empirical test aimed at learning what works and meets three criteria: a bullet must be low-cost, low-risk, and low-distraction… 10Xers use bullets to empirically validate what will actually work. Based on that empirical validation, they then concentrate their resources to fire a cannonball, enabling large returns from concentrated bets.”</p>
<p>Consider testing and reviewing through the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Confirm that your content is appearing within the DOM.</li>
<li>Test a subset of pages to see if Google can index content.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Manually check quotes from your content.</li>
<li><p>Fetch with Google and see if content appears.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fetch with Google supposedly occurs around the load event or before timeout. It’s a great test to check to see if Google will be able to see your content and whether or not you’re blocking JavaScript in your robots.txt. Although Fetch with Google is not foolproof, it’s a good starting point.</p>
</li>
<li>Note: If you aren’t verified in GSC, try<br><a href="https://technicalseo.com/seo-tools/fetch-render/" target="_blank" rel="external">Technicalseo.com’s Fetch and Render As Any Bot Tool</a><br>.</li>
</ul>
<p>After you’ve tested all this, what if something’s not working and search engines and bots are struggling to index and obtain your content? Perhaps you’re concerned about alternative search engines (DuckDuckGo, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.), or maybe you’re leveraging meta information that needs to be parsed by other bots, such as Twitter summary cards or Facebook Open Graph tags. If any of this is identified in testing or presents itself as a concern, an HTML snapshot may be the only decision.</p>
<h4 id="2-HTML-SNAPSHOTS"><a href="#2-HTML-SNAPSHOTS" class="headerlink" title="2. HTML SNAPSHOTS"></a>2. HTML SNAPSHOTS</h4><h4 id="What-are-HTmL-snapshots"><a href="#What-are-HTmL-snapshots" class="headerlink" title="What are HTmL snapshots?"></a>What are HTmL snapshots?</h4><p>HTML snapshots are a fully rendered page (as one might see in the DOM) that can be returned to search engine bots (think: a static HTML version of the DOM).</p>
<p><a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2009/10/proposal-for-making-ajax-crawlable.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Google introduced HTML snapshots 2009</a>,<a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2015/10/deprecating-our-ajax-crawling-scheme.html" target="_blank" rel="external">deprecated (but still supported) them in 2015</a>, and awkwardly mentioned them as<a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2016/11/building-indexable-progressive-web-apps.html" target="_blank" rel="external">an element to “avoid”</a>in late 2016. HTML snapshots are a contentious topic with Google. However, they’re important to understand, because in certain situations they’re necessary.</p>
<p>If search engines (or sites like Facebook) cannot grasp your JavaScript, it’s better to return an HTML snapshot than not to have your content indexed and understood at all. Ideally, your site would leverage some form of user-agent detection on the server side and return the HTML snapshot to the bot.</p>
<p>At the same time, one must recognize that Google wants the same experience as the user (i.e., only provide Google with an HTML snapshot if the tests are dire and the<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/js-sites-wg" target="_blank" rel="external">JavaScript search group</a>cannot provide support for your situation).</p>
<h4 id="Considerations"><a href="#Considerations" class="headerlink" title="Considerations"></a>Considerations</h4><p>When considering HTML snapshots, you must consider that Google has deprecated this AJAX recommendation. Although Google technically still supports it, Google recommends avoiding it. Yes, Google changed its mind and now want to receive the same experience as the user. This direction makes sense, as it allows the bot to receive an experience more true to the user experience.</p>
<p>A second consideration factor relates to the risk of cloaking. If the HTML snapshots are found to not represent the experience on the page, it’s considered a cloaking risk. Straight from the source:</p>
<p>“The HTML snapshot must contain the same content as the end user would see in a browser. If this is not the case, it may be considered cloaking.”</p>
<p>–<a href="https://developers.google.com/webmasters/ajax-crawling/docs/faq#cloaking" target="_blank" rel="external">Google Developer AJAX Crawling FAQs</a></p>
<h4 id="Benefits"><a href="#Benefits" class="headerlink" title="Benefits"></a>Benefits</h4><p>Despite the considerations, HTML snapshots have powerful advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Knowledge that search engines and crawlers will be able to understand the experience.<ul>
<li>Certain types of JavaScript may be harder for Google to grasp (cough… Angular (also colloquially referred to as AngularJS 2) …cough).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other search engines and crawlers (think: Bing, Facebook) will be able to understand the experience.<ul>
<li>Bing, among other search engines, has not stated that it can crawl and index JavaScript. HTML snapshots may be the only solution for a JavaScript-heavy site. As always, test to make sure that this is the case before diving in.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/ZRRz6rR.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="Site-latency"><a href="#Site-latency" class="headerlink" title="Site latency"></a>Site latency</h4><p>When browsers receive an HTML document and create the DOM (although there is some level of pre-scanning), most resources are loaded as they appear within the HTML document. This means that if you have a huge file toward the top of your HTML document, a browser will load that immense file first.</p>
<p>The concept of Google’s critical rendering path is to load what the user needs as soon as possible, which can be translated to → “get everything above-the-fold in front of the user, ASAP.”</p>
<h4 id="Critical-Rendering-Path-Optimized-Rendering-Loads-Progressively-ASAP"><a href="#Critical-Rendering-Path-Optimized-Rendering-Loads-Progressively-ASAP" class="headerlink" title="Critical Rendering Path - Optimized Rendering Loads Progressively ASAP:"></a>Critical Rendering Path - Optimized Rendering Loads Progressively ASAP:</h4><p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/zMjQFrF.png!web" alt=""></p>
<p>Image<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/" target="_blank" rel="external">source</a></p>
<p>However, if you have unnecessary resources or JavaScript files clogging up the page’s ability to load, you get “render-blocking JavaScript.” Meaning: your JavaScript is blocking the page’s potential to appear as if it’s loading faster (also called: perceived latency).</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/BVNRN3B.png!web" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="Render-blocking-JavaScript-–-Solutions"><a href="#Render-blocking-JavaScript-–-Solutions" class="headerlink" title="Render-blocking JavaScript – Solutions"></a>Render-blocking JavaScript – Solutions</h4><p>If you analyze your page speed results (through tools like<a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/" target="_blank" rel="external">Page Speed Insights Tool</a>,<a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">WebPageTest.org</a>, CatchPoint, etc.) and determine that there is a render-blocking JavaScript issue, here are three potential solutions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Inline: Add the JavaScript in the HTML document.</li>
<li><p>Async: Make JavaScript asynchronous (i.e., add “async” attribute to HTML tag).</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/Bba67bj.png!web" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li>Defer: By placing JavaScript lower within the HTML.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="http://img1.tuicool.com/FbU7n2N.png!web" alt=""></p>
<p>_!!! Important note:_It’s important to understand that scripts must be arranged in order of precedence. Scripts that are used to load the above-the-fold content must be prioritized and should not be deferred. Also, any script that references another file can only be used after the referenced file has loaded. Make sure to work closely with your development team to confirm that there are no interruptions to the user’s experience.</p>

Make sure your content is crawlable, obtainable, and isn’t developing site latency obstructions. The key = every situation demands testing. Based on the results, evaluate potential solutions.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Good design takes time and often years of experience and experimentation to getright.Itis built on certain conventions and rules that serve as the basis of a good design. A common example of a design convention is the use of contrasting colors to make text look better on a colored background.<strong>Vaunt</strong>is a free macOS that lets you find the dominant colors in an image. It’s a simple menu bar utility that you can drag &amp; drop imaged on to. It will find the dominant colors in an image and display all shades of it that appear in the image. You can click a color and its HEX code will automatically be copied to your clipboard.</p>
<p>Download and run Vaunt. It runs entirely from the menu bar. Click the menu bar icon to open the app and drag &amp; drop the image you want to analyze into the designated area. Give it a few seconds and it will show you a selection of colors that appear in the image.</p>
<p>Vaunt will show you multiple shades of the dominant color. It finds this color using a clustering algorithm and it accounts for the variation in shades by providing you different ones that it detects in the image. Click a color to copy its HEX code to your clipboard.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/mac-os/how-to-find-the-dominant-colors-in-an-image/attachment/vaunt/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://cloud.addictivetips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/vaunt.jpg" alt="" title="vaunt"></a></p>
<p>We tested the app out with a very psychedelic Alice in Wonderland wallpaper and the poster for Suicide Squad (2016). In both cases, there were two very distinct colors that were dominant in the image. We ran the images multiple times through Vaunt and it returned at least two different dominant colors for each image.</p>

<p>The color that Vaunt identifies as dominant depends on the area it analyzes. For images like posters or wallpapers, the results can vary greatly each time you run them through the app. This is because the app is looking at and analyzing a different part of the image. Vaunt can analyze both PNG and JPG images.</p>

<p>The Armani brand is already synonymous with high fashion, and now the company wants to add smartwatches to its lineup. Armani announced that its firstAndroid Wear 2.0 device, the Emporio Armani Connected, will go on sale in its stores starting on September 14. The company previously<a href="http://www.androidauthority.com/emporio-armani-connected-hybrid-watch-725061/" target="_blank" rel="external">released a hybrid smartwatch</a>that went on sale in the fall of 2016.</p>

<p>The new touchscreen wearable will be one of the over 300 different hybrid and full smartwatches<a href="http://www.androidauthority.com/fossil-goes-full-android-wear-300-connected-watches-planned-year-759053/" target="_blank" rel="external">that will be made by Fossil</a>, which is also making and marketing devices for other fashion brands like Michael Kors, Skagen, Diesel, DKNY, and Marc Jacobs. In this case, the Emporio Armani Connected will be sold with support for up to eight different straps, along with a number of exclusive watchfaces. There’s not a lot of info on its hardware specs, but on the surface it looks it will be fairly typical Android Wear smartwatch, with a round display and a Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor inside.</p>
<p>However, you are paying for the brand name, not the hardware, when you decide to get the Emporio Armani Connected. Pricing has not yet been announced but we expect it to be on the higher side of Android Wear products.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A long time ago I bought an Ethernet ENC28J60 but I just recently tested it and, although I enjoy Java and I’ve used it in all of my previous projects to develop the interface between Arduino and server, it was clear to me that Python would be a much better choice in this case.</p>
<p>In 2014, I decided to use<a href="https://panamahitek.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Panama Hitek Arduino SDK</a>and then I sent them an email sharing my experience with their new SDK version. In 2016, I randomly met the guys from the Panama Hitek at the Fedora Latin America Meeting in IRC. Sharing your experience as a developer and be engaging in communities is very important, maybe you will meet the developers of your favorite framework in these spaces or even work with them. For me, it’s one more example of the importance of sharing knowledge and ideas through articles, talks, meetings etc. So, don’t be shy or scared of sharing what you know.</p>
<h2 id="IoT-is-about-being-connected"><a href="#IoT-is-about-being-connected" class="headerlink" title="IoT is about being connected"></a>IoT is about being connected</h2><p>IoT, embedded systems and smart devices are different concepts and there’s a constant confusion when using these terms.</p>
<p>If your device is disconnected from Internet, it probably isn’t generating the value of an IoT device. Being connected is more than reading commands remotely from an app, it’s a possibility to interact in different ways with your client and other systems like Twitter and also to collect useful information that can be used to make it even smarter.</p>

There’s a<a href="https://arduino-tweet.appspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Tweet Library for Arduino</a>available but it’s deprecated and needs refactoring to work with Arduino versions higher than 1.6.4.</p>

<h3 id="The-easy-way"><a href="#The-easy-way" class="headerlink" title="The easy way"></a>The easy way</h3><p>Working with pointers and in a low level can be complicated if you don’t have experience with C and micro-controller, registers, digital systems etc. Use a python script and it will be much easier to code and maintain the software. Python will be responsible for exposing a web server which will then be consumed by your Arduino and send the content (e.g, sensor values, commands to turn on or off the lights etc) to Twitter. Note that Arduino UNO has limitations when building HTTP requests (it was necessary to use GET method instead of POST to create a tweet) and for this reason Python<strong>doesn’t expose an API</strong>.</p>

<p>EtherShield and ETHER_28J60 are common libraries used in most of tutorials, but UIPEthernet is compatible with the original Ethernet which allows you to use the examples avaiable in the Arduino IDE (File &gt; Examples &gt; Ethernet) just by replacing:</p>

<li>Creating a Suggestion Dropdown</li>
</ul>
<p>As far as dropdowns go, the most popular one on the Internet is Google’s AutoSuggest.</p>
<p>As you start to type, Google tries to guess what the user is looking for and provides a dropdown with suggestions so the user doesn’t have to type everything.</p>
<p>In the last post of this [link]series, we’ll discuss how to create a autosuggest dropdown control for your own UI.</p>
<h2 id="Overview"><a href="#Overview" class="headerlink" title="Overview"></a>Overview</h2><p>Throughout this series, you already know by now that we need to write JavaScript for our control.</p>
<p>For our autosuggest dropdown, we’ll use a standard Text Box along with a custom DIV that displays below it.</p>
<p>As the user types in the text box, we’ll take their input and send it back to the server using a Web API.</p>
<p>This is probably the only post in the series without a ViewModel since everything is done through JavaScript.</p>
<h2 id="Our-WebAPI"><a href="#Our-WebAPI" class="headerlink" title="Our WebAPI"></a>Our WebAPI</h2><p>For our autosuggest to work, we need a Web API similar to our<a href="https://www.danylkoweb.com/Blog/cascading-dropdowns-in-aspnet-mvc-JY" target="_blank" rel="external">Cascading Dropdown WebAPI</a>.</p>
<p>It’s similar, but instead we want distinct make and models of cars and we only want 10 of them displayed in the dropdown.</p>

<p>When the user presses a key, we check to see the following codes:</p>
<ul>
<li>ESC (27) - Close the dropdown when it’s visible.</li>
<li>Down Arrow (40) - Move to the next option in the dropdown.</li>
<li>Up Arrow (38) - Move to the previous option in the dropdown.</li>
<li>Enter (13) - Select the highlighted item in the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, when none of our keys are caught, we assume the user is entering their search criteria.</p>
<p>We show the “dropdown” by removing the hidden CSS class and make our call to the Web API.</p>
<p>Once retrieved, we add the items to our list and attach click events to our anchors in the list.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In this final post to our dropdown series, I wanted to show how easy it is to create an autosuggest dropdown. Not only did we make our dropdown list clickable, we also added keyboard events for those keyboard-jockeys who avoid the mouse.</p>
<p>This dropdown series explained thebasics of dropdowns, how to use<a href="https://www.danylkoweb.com/Blog/using-dropdowns-in-grids-JX" target="_blank" rel="external">dropdowns inside and outside of webgrids</a>, mutiple ways to<a href="https://www.danylkoweb.com/Blog/cascading-dropdowns-in-aspnet-mvc-JY" target="_blank" rel="external">implement cascading dropdowns</a>, and, of course, how to create an autosuggest dropdown.</p>
<p>I hope this series has shown a detailed and easy way to implement dropdowns in ASP.NET MVC.</p>
<p>Was this autosuggest easy to implement? Is there a better way to do this? Post your comments below and let’s discuss.</p>

    <title>Duel: gdb vs. linked lists, trees, and hash tables</title>

    <published>2017-06-19T00:00:00.000Z</published>
    <updated>2017-06-19T10:00:48.340Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My first encounter with the gdb command<code>duel</code>was on some old IRIX about 15 years ago. I immediately loved how convenient it was for displaying various data structures during MySQL debugging, and I wished Linux had something similar. Later I found out that Duel was not something IRIX specific, but a public domain patch for gdb 4.6 written in ’93 by Michael Golan. Unfortunately, it never got into gdb (for licensing reasons, so I’ve heard). Now the gdb 8 is out, and the patch, obviously doesn’t apply. Instead of fixing the patch, I’ve re-implemented Duel in Python, using<a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Python-API.html" target="_blank" rel="external">gdb Python API</a>and the<a href="https://github.com/igordejanovic/Arpeggio" target="_blank" rel="external">Arpeggio</a>parser. Now it can be loaded run-time into your gdb, no patching or compilation is needed. And, hopefully, it will work over many gdb versions, as it no longer relies on undocumented gdb internals. So, allow me to introduce…<strong>Duel.py</strong>for gdb!</p>
<h2 id="Examples"><a href="#Examples" class="headerlink" title="Examples"></a>Examples</h2><p>Let’s start with a few examples, to get the taste of it. Michael Golan managed to create a concise but very naturally-looking language. For example, while<code>a-&gt;b</code>means the element<code>b</code>of the structure pointer<code>a</code>, in Duel<code>a--&gt;b</code>means to walk the linked list, producing the sequence of values<code>a</code>,<code>a-&gt;b</code>,<code>a-&gt;b-&gt;b</code>, and so on. In MariaDB, all tables of a query are stored in a linked list, and it can be printed with just one command:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div><div class="line">7</div><div class="line">8</div><div class="line">9</div><div class="line">10</div><div class="line">11</div><div class="line">12</div><div class="line">13</div><div class="line">14</div><div class="line">15</div><div class="line">16</div><div class="line">17</div><div class="line">18</div><div class="line">19</div><div class="line">20</div><div class="line">21</div><div class="line">22</div><div class="line">23</div><div class="line">24</div><div class="line">25</div><div class="line">26</div><div class="line">27</div><div class="line">28</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">(gdb) dl table_list--</div><div class="line">&gt;</div><div class="line">next_local-</div><div class="line">&gt;</div><div class="line">table_name</div><div class="line">tables-</div><div class="line">&gt;</div><div class="line">table_name = </div><div class="line">0x7fffc40126b8</div><div class="line">&quot;t2&quot;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">tables-</div><div class="line">&gt;</div><div class="line">next_local-</div><div class="line">&gt;</div><div class="line">table_name = </div><div class="line">0x7fffc4012d18</div><div class="line">&quot;t1&quot;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">tables--</div><div class="line">&gt;</div><div class="line">next_local[[</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">]]-</div><div class="line">&gt;</div><div class="line">table_name = </div><div class="line">0x7fffc4013388</div><div class="line">&quot;t1&quot;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Also, quite naturally, instead of a number, you can specify a range, great for printing arrays:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div><div class="line">7</div><div class="line">8</div><div class="line">9</div><div class="line">10</div><div class="line">11</div><div class="line">12</div><div class="line">13</div><div class="line">14</div><div class="line">15</div><div class="line">16</div><div class="line">17</div><div class="line">18</div><div class="line">19</div><div class="line">20</div><div class="line">21</div><div class="line">22</div><div class="line">23</div><div class="line">24</div><div class="line">25</div><div class="line">26</div><div class="line">27</div><div class="line">28</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">(gdb) dl longopts[</div><div class="line">0.</div><div class="line">.405</div><div class="line">].name</div><div class="line">longopts[</div><div class="line">0</div><div class="line">].name = </div><div class="line">&quot;help&quot;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">longopts[</div><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">].name = </div><div class="line">&quot;allow-suspicious-udfs&quot;</div><div class="line">&lt;</div><div class="line">...</div><div class="line"> cut </div><div class="line">...</div><div class="line">&gt;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">longopts[</div><div class="line">404</div><div class="line">].name = </div><div class="line">&quot;session_track_transaction_info&quot;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">longopts[</div><div class="line">405</div><div class="line">].name = </div><div class="line">&quot;session_track_state_change&quot;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>And instead of any expression, you can specify a set of expressions:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div><div class="line">7</div><div class="line">8</div><div class="line">9</div><div class="line">10</div><div class="line">11</div><div class="line">12</div><div class="line">13</div><div class="line">14</div><div class="line">15</div><div class="line">16</div><div class="line">17</div><div class="line">18</div><div class="line">19</div><div class="line">20</div><div class="line">21</div><div class="line">22</div><div class="line">23</div><div class="line">24</div><div class="line">25</div><div class="line">26</div><div class="line">27</div><div class="line">28</div><div class="line">29</div><div class="line">30</div><div class="line">31</div><div class="line">32</div><div class="line">33</div><div class="line">34</div><div class="line">35</div><div class="line">36</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">(gdb) </div><div class="line">dl</div><div class="line"> my_long_options[</div><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">..</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">].(name,def_value)</div><div class="line">my_long_options[</div><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">].(name) = </div><div class="line">&quot;allow-suspicious-udfs&quot;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">my_long_options[</div><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">].(def_value) = </div><div class="line">0</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">my_long_options[</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">].(name) = </div><div class="line">&quot;ansi&quot;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">my_long_options[</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">].(def_value) = </div><div class="line">0</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">my_long_options[</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">].(name) = </div><div class="line">&quot;autocommit&quot;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">my_long_options[</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">].(def_value) = </div><div class="line">1</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<h2 id="Concepts"><a href="#Concepts" class="headerlink" title="Concepts"></a>Concepts</h2><p>Duel is built on the idea that every expression can return multiple values. You’ve seen<code>a..b</code>,<code>a--&gt;b</code>, and<code>a,b</code>as examples of such expressions. Any such expression can be used normally with other operators. Like in</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div><div class="line">7</div><div class="line">8</div><div class="line">9</div><div class="line">10</div><div class="line">11</div><div class="line">12</div><div class="line">13</div><div class="line">14</div><div class="line">15</div><div class="line">16</div><div class="line">17</div><div class="line">18</div><div class="line">19</div><div class="line">20</div><div class="line">21</div><div class="line">22</div><div class="line">23</div><div class="line">24</div><div class="line">25</div><div class="line">26</div><div class="line">27</div><div class="line">28</div><div class="line">29</div><div class="line">30</div><div class="line">31</div><div class="line">32</div><div class="line">33</div><div class="line">34</div><div class="line">35</div><div class="line">36</div><div class="line">37</div><div class="line">38</div><div class="line">39</div><div class="line">40</div><div class="line">41</div><div class="line">42</div><div class="line">43</div><div class="line">44</div><div class="line">45</div><div class="line">46</div><div class="line">47</div><div class="line">48</div><div class="line">49</div><div class="line">50</div><div class="line">51</div><div class="line">52</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">(</div><div class="line">gdb</div><div class="line">) dl (</div><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">..</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">)+(</div><div class="line">100</div><div class="line">,</div><div class="line">200</div><div class="line">)</div><div class="line">(</div><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">) + (</div><div class="line">100</div><div class="line">) = </div><div class="line">101</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">(</div><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">) + (</div><div class="line">200</div><div class="line">) = </div><div class="line">201</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">(</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">) + (</div><div class="line">100</div><div class="line">) = </div><div class="line">102</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">(</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">) + (</div><div class="line">200</div><div class="line">) = </div><div class="line">202</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">(</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">) + (</div><div class="line">100</div><div class="line">) = </div><div class="line">103</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">(</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">) + (</div><div class="line">200</div><div class="line">) = </div><div class="line">203</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Besides operators that generate multiple values, there are operators that stop generation and grep-like operators that filter generated values. Let’s take a closer look.</p>
<h2 id="Operators"><a href="#Operators" class="headerlink" title="Operators"></a>Operators</h2><p>Duel syntax is C-like, C operators work as expected, one can use C-style casts, refer to variables and invoke functions of the inferior (program, being debugged). But additionally one can use special Duel operators that deal with multiple values.</p>
<h4 id="Ranges-and-lists-and"><a href="#Ranges-and-lists-and" class="headerlink" title="Ranges and lists,..and,"></a>Ranges and lists,<code>..</code>and<code>,</code></h4><p>You’ve seen examples above. These operators look rather familiar, they exist in other languages too. A range can have both or only one end specified,<code>..x</code>means a range of<code>x</code>elements, same as<code>0..x-1</code>. An open range<code>x..</code>will generate values ad infinitum (or until the counter overflows, whatever comes first), one usually uses it with the<code>@</code>“until” operator.</p>
<h4 id="Until"><a href="#Until" class="headerlink" title="Until,@"></a>Until,<code>@</code></h4><p>In the<code>x@y</code>expression,<code>x</code>will keep generating values until<code>y</code>becomes true. For example,</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div><div class="line">7</div><div class="line">8</div><div class="line">9</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">(gdb) </div><div class="line">dl</div><div class="line"> arr[</div><div class="line">0</div><div class="line">..]@(</div><div class="line">count</div><div class="line">&gt;</div><div class="line">10</div><div class="line">)</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>will print elements of the<code>arr</code>array, until<code>arr[i].count</code>becomes larger than ten. As a convenient shortcut, the second argument can be a constant, in this case the generation stops as soon as the generated value becomes equal to this constant.

<h3 id="About-“wants”-“cans”-“needs”-and-“shoulds”"><a href="#About-“wants”-“cans”-“needs”-and-“shoulds”" class="headerlink" title="About “wants”, “cans”, “needs”, and “shoulds”"></a>About “wants”, “cans”, “needs”, and “shoulds”</h3><p>The original<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/search?q=volume&amp;restrict_sr=on" target="_blank" rel="external">reddit post</a>has now hundreds of examples of terrible volume UI, and it keeps growing — a fun exercise/joke, that can strengthen one’s creative muscles and ability to think outside of the box. People have been participating simply for the fun of coming up with the most absurd and weird interactions and interface elements.</p>
<p>But there’s definitely a reflection point about the state our industry here.</p>
<p>I’m sure a lot of people reading this has, at some point in their careers,<strong>felt that urge of innovating no matter what</strong>. An uncontrollable desire of redesigning something that hasn’t been redesigned for too long. It_has_to be recreated. And it_has_to be innovative. Right?</p>
<p>That’s where the wants, cans, needs, and shoulds story comes in.</p>
<ul>
<li>Everybody<br><strong>wants</strong><br>to innovate. The design industry keeps nudging us to be creative, innovative, and to deliver design solutions that have never been thought of before. Pressure is on us. We are bombarded with messages telling us that, in order to be considered a solid designer, we<br><em>have</em><br>to innovate at any cost.</li>
<li>A lot of people<br><strong>can</strong><br>innovate. I definitely<br><em>can</em><br>redesign the volume control UI. All it takes is a bit of creativity and moderate design skills. Prototyping tools are becoming increasingly accessible, as well as other technologies that allow to bring to fruition whatever idea comes to mind. A few hours in front of Principle or Framer lets you create an extremely refined prototype of the interaction you are envisioning. You can also decide to create an app/site/chatbot to solve that same issue. You<br><em>can</em><br>.</li>
<li>No one<br><strong>needs</strong><br>to. Let’s be honest: the volume control design pattern has been around for decades, works pretty well for the majority of users, and is incredibly familiar to a lot of people. You don’t<br><em>need</em><br>to reinvent it.</li>
</ul>
<p>But then there’s the<strong>should</strong>.</p>
<p>ShouldI redesign the volume control UI?</p>
<p>Shouldis interesting because of its subjectiveness. It’s a question that only makes sense to be asked in first person. And you_have_to know about much more than just design to be able to answer it — you have to understand about business, technology, culture, people. Answering the<strong>should</strong>question is a skill you only get after many, many years answering questions alike.</p>
<p>We can try to quantify or measure the should, which makes sense some of the time. But part of it is, and will ever be, intuition. How is yours?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple added a new feature in the<a href="https://www.addictivetips.com/ios/how-to-set-up-the-bedtime-alarm-in-ios-10/" target="_blank" rel="external">iOS clock app called Bed Time</a>. The feature helps you get 7-8 hours of sleep everyday. It asks you what time it is you have to wake up the next day, and then tells you when to go to bed. It’s useful considering most people use their phones as an alarm. The only thing is, if you’re awake and working, the device you’re looking at is going to be a desktop, not your phone.<strong>Sandman</strong>is a desktop app available for Windows, Mac, and Linux that does something similar to the iOS clock app. It gives you bed time alerts that ensure you get 7-8 hours of sleep.</p>
<p>Sandman looks at two things when it gives you bed time alerts; your working hours, and when you need to wake up. The app was designed with developers in mind who are prone to working long hours and missing essential sleep. The app learns what times a user works and tells them when enough is enough and they should go to bed.</p>
<p>Open Sandman. When you start out, it doesn’t know what your work schedule is. All you can do is tell the app when you need to wake up. It will work with that until it knows you schedule better.</p>

<p>When it’s time for bed, Sandman will give you an alert. You can dismiss it if you don’t like sleep, or you can use the Shutdown button on the alert to turn your system off and hit the hay.</p>

<p>Sandman is pretty smart. It takes into account how long you need to fall asleep. Some people fall asleep almost immediately. Other people stay awake for a few hours contemplating the meaning of life. Sandman’s bed time alerts can factor that time in. To configure how long it takes to for you to fall asleep, go to Sandman’s preferences via the Ctrl+P  shortcut.</p>
<p>Set how long it takes you to fall asleep. Sandman can also alert you when you’ve been working for twelve hours straight though you can customize this time slot to make it shorter or longer. Additionally, you can switch from the 12 hour format to the 24 hour format if you like.</p>

<p>If you lose track of time when you’re working then consider using Sandman. Work is important but doing it in a sleep deprived state is hardly good for you.</p>
<p>You can dismiss an alert from Sandman if you’re not ready to go to bed, but don’t make a habit of it. Try and get the required sleep you need everyday.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When a system goes to sleep, it preserves the state it was in. If you had apps and files open on your desktop, they will still be there when you get back. Everything from your work setup to your system configurations is stored. When you wake your system, you can pick up work where you left it off. macOS is no different. When it wakes from sleep, everything is exactly where you left it which is a good thing except in the case of your system’s volume. The volume is one thing that you might want to reset when you wake your system. If you left the volume high because you were playing music, it might startle you when you wake your system from sleep. Here’s how you can change the system volume on wake on macOS.</p>
<p>To change the system volume on wake, you need an app called<strong>AutoVolume</strong>. It’s a free open source macOS app that well reset the system volume when you wake your Mac from sleep.</p>
<p>Download and run AutoVolume. The app has a very basic interface. You set the volume you want your Mac to reset to when it wakes from sleep and enable it. Once you’ve set the volume, enable the app and close it. Be careful you don’t click the ‘Quit’ button. Quitting the app is different from closing it. If you quit the app, it will not change the system volume on Wake.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/mac-os/change-the-system-volume-on-wake-macos/attachment/autovolume/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://cloud.addictivetips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AutoVolume.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>After you set the volume level, you can forget about the app. You won’t see any indication of the app running. It doesn’t so much as have a Menu bar icon. When you’re done, either put your Mac to sleep or let it enter sleep automatically.</p>

<p>When you wake your Mac to use it the next time around, the volume will have changed to the one you set in AutoVolume.</p>
<p>Although you can set AutoVolume to run at start up, it doesn’t change the system volume when you boot your Mac. This app in its current state is meant to work only when you wake your Mac. If you normally let your Mac go to sleep instead of shutting it down at the end of each day, AutoVolume will ensure you or your co-workers aren’t blasted with loud audio notifications or music.</p>
<p>The app is still under development and it has an interesting list of requested features so, even if it isn’t feature rich at the moment, it’s an app you want to keep your eye on.</p>

    <title>5 Former Design Trends That Aren’t Cool Anymore (So Stop Using Them)</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="5-Former-Design-Trends-That-Aren’t-Cool-Anymore-So-Stop-Using-Them"><a href="#5-Former-Design-Trends-That-Aren’t-Cool-Anymore-So-Stop-Using-Them" class="headerlink" title="5 Former Design Trends That Aren’t Cool Anymore (So Stop Using Them)"></a>5 Former Design Trends That Aren’t Cool Anymore (So Stop Using Them)</h2><p>If you’re like me, looking at your own design work from a few years ago can often result in some laughable or even cringe-worthy moments. Design styles have been steadily evolving and most of us can’t help but be affected by these changes. Who among us hasn’t piled on the cheesy Photoshop layer effects, all the while thinking the result was downright awesome?</p>
<p>However, some of us are a little slower to evolve than others. Today we’ll be taking a walk down memory lane and looking at five design trends that used to be super cool, but now simply tend to make your design look outdated and even ugly. If you’re currently still stuck on these trends, it might be time to move along! We’ll help you out with some modern alternative practices that you can use to bring your design skills into the current year in a hurry.</p>
<h2 id="Let’s-Make-Fun-of-Design"><a href="#Let’s-Make-Fun-of-Design" class="headerlink" title="Let’s Make Fun of Design"></a>Let’s Make Fun of Design</h2><p>We designers tend to take ourselves far too seriously. A post like this could easily lead to derogatory finger pointing and superiority complexes, but let’s go ahead and admit up front that we’ve all flirted with at least a few of these trends, many of us have jumped on board every single one of them.</p>
<p>The only way to escape this fact is to be a new designer, then all you’re doing is jumping on the trends of today. Don’t worry, you won’t regret or perhaps even acknowledge these decisions for at least another three to five years.</p>
<h3 id="What-Are-Design-Trends-Good-For"><a href="#What-Are-Design-Trends-Good-For" class="headerlink" title="What Are Design Trends Good For?"></a>What Are Design Trends Good For?</h3><p>The key to analyzing design trends is to remember that they aren’t inherently good or bad. Instead, they merely serve as a way to observe and remember the collective tastes of bygone eras.</p>
<p>By examining which design practices seem out of style and dated, you can avoid being that guy who still wears tie dye t-shirts on a first date.</p>
<p>In this way, they’re a fantastic history lesson on how styles have evolved over the years. Try to think of past design trends like fashion, something that was cool when you are young will eventually become deplorable, but don’t worry, by the time you’re old it’ll probably see a resurgence.</p>
<p>The practical lesson here is that by examining which design practices seem out of style and dated, you can avoid being that guy who still wears tie dye t-shirts on a first date. Is it the case that you should absolutely abandon all of the practices on this list forever? Absolutely not. Just like with that tie dye shirt, you can probably find a time or two where these seem appropriate, even if only ironically. And who knows? They could come back and become cool again before long!</p>
<h2 id="Bevel-and-Emboss"><a href="#Bevel-and-Emboss" class="headerlink" title="Bevel and Emboss"></a>Bevel and Emboss</h2><p>I know it’s tempting. You open up that Photoshop Effects window and_Bevel and Emboss_is like a siren calling from the rocks, pleading with you to add a touch of realism to your design. Before you know it, you’re staring at something like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/IZ7FVb3.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>There’s almost nothing that screams late 90s/early 2000s design like a good old bevel treatment. We went crazy with these things and put them on everything we touched. Even beloved, age old brand logos weren’t safe from the far reaching effects of this trend.</p>
<p>Like that picture of you on Facebook with the skinny jeans, we now look back on this trend with a “what was I thinking?” attitude. Don’t knockout it though, you’ll do the exact same thing in ten years to whatever you’re working on today!</p>
<h3 id="Do-This-Instead"><a href="#Do-This-Instead" class="headerlink" title="Do This Instead"></a>Do This Instead</h3><p>These days the trend across the board is much more minimalistic that it was ten years ago. We’ve gone past faux realistic bevels and, for the most part, dropped them completely. Now objects tend to have simple, uniform edges with almost no effects apart from the occasional subtle shadow.<a href="http://adrians.info/" target="_blank" rel="external">The World of Adrian Le Bas</a>is a prime example:</p>
<p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/aMnEvmA.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="Web-2-0-Gloss"><a href="#Web-2-0-Gloss" class="headerlink" title="Web 2.0 Gloss"></a>Web 2.0 Gloss</h2><p>The bevel and emboss trend wasn’t suddenly abandoned one day in favor of minimalism. Instead, it had to evolve into something even more ornate before we decided to run in the completely opposite direction.</p>
<p>Bevels alone tend to give an almost clay-like look to an object. Add in some shine though and you’ve suddenly got some fancy plastic and glass effects:</p>
<p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/7vQB32Q.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>This one still hasn’t effectively been killed off, you need not travel far to find its influences. I’ll even gloss up a button or two myself from time to time, though certainly not to this extreme. The problem is of course that stylistically, designers have largely dropped this and are moving once again towards more subtle choices. Implementing a heavily glossed web 2.0 style on your site is a surefire way to make a brand new site seem like it’s already due for a design refresh.</p>
<h3 id="Do-This-Instead-1"><a href="#Do-This-Instead-1" class="headerlink" title="Do This Instead"></a>Do This Instead</h3><p>The good news is that “attractive” buttons are even easier to make these days. All you need is a little border-radius and a slight drop-shadow or gradient. The effect is a nice button style that stands out without being too flashy. Check out this example from<a href="http://www.shopify.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Shopify</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/eYfumqq.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>It’s interesting to note how technology affects design trends. The Photoshop-centric effects of yesterday are giving way to CSS3 styles of today. You can expect this to continue as new possibilities come to light with pure code-driven design.</p>
<h2 id="Lots-of-Cursive-Text"><a href="#Lots-of-Cursive-Text" class="headerlink" title="Lots of Cursive Text"></a>Lots of Cursive Text</h2><p><img src="http://img1.tuicool.com/JRVZR3a.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>This one is a possible exception to my earlier statement about design trends being neither good nor bad from a purely objective standpoint. If a trend actually stands in the way of the success of a design, then it’s easy to argue that it is in fact an example of “bad” design.</p>
<p>I find this to be the case with big blocks of cursive text. For some reason, this is a trend that simply refuses to die. Following this trend is a double whammy of ugly design. Not only does it make your site uncomfortable to browse and read through, it also tends to reflect many of the typeface woes of the 1990s. If there’s one thing you_don’t_currently want someone to say about your site, it’s that it looks like something from when developers with no real design experience were first beginning to apply basic styles to websites.</p>
<h3 id="Do-This-Instead-2"><a href="#Do-This-Instead-2" class="headerlink" title="Do This Instead"></a>Do This Instead</h3><p>Instead of hitting your visitors over the head with overuse of that fancy typeface that you found free online, try instead sprinkling it in extremely selectively. Elementary school taught you that cursive is for professional communication; they lied. In design it should be used very selectively as an occasional accent to more readable alternatives.</p>
<p>There are dozens of<a href="https://designshack.net/articles/inspiration/100-beautiful-script-brush-calligraphy-fonts/" target="_blank" rel="external">beautiful script and calligraphy fonts</a>that have popped up in recent years from independent artists. The key is to choose one that’s readable, and don’t over-use it!</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/B7bemyB.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="The-Burst"><a href="#The-Burst" class="headerlink" title="The Burst"></a>The Burst</h2><p>This one has roots dating back to the early days of even print design. The burst is a tried and true way to grab your viewer’s attention. It says “hey, here’s some important information!” in a easy to implement and instantly recognizable way. The problem: it’s ugly and makes your design look like a marketing professor threw up on it.</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/Ibi22yj.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>My main problem with this is that it reflects a complete lack of thought and imagination. Instead of considering how to effectively integrate a logical and appropriate break into the design pattern, the designers who use this simply use the very first idea that pops into their heads. It would also be the very first idea of every non-designer as well, making it the most uncreative design element you could possibly use.</p>
<h3 id="Do-This-Instead-3"><a href="#Do-This-Instead-3" class="headerlink" title="Do This Instead"></a>Do This Instead</h3><p>The simple solution here is to put a_tiny bit_more thought into creating an element that fits with your overall design theme but still violates the page enough to grab attention. While there’s nothing worse than an invasive pop-over to promote a sale or discount, putting some thought into a stylish and well-designed solution can work well.<a href="https://www.pixelunion.net/apps/pixelpop/" target="_blank" rel="external">PixelPop</a>is a tool that does this perfectly, with thoughtful design and simple templates.</p>
<p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/NbMRvaQ.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="Retro-Redemption"><a href="#Retro-Redemption" class="headerlink" title="Retro Redemption"></a>Retro Redemption</h3><p>The real key to mastering design trends is to know what they suggest. Don’t implement a certain style just because you feel good about it today, instead analyze what it is that you want to achieve and what will work for and/or against that idea.</p>
<p>For instance, if you’re trying to create a modern e-commerce site that reflects current style choices in web design, you should avoid bursts like they’re an 80s rock-a-mullet. However, if you’re_intentionally_creating a retro look, then suddenly bursts once again become a perfectly legitimate and even attractive choice. Check out the<a href="http://www.tomanddan.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Tom and Dan Show site</a>below to see this idea in action:</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/ayMFzim.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="Dramatic-Drop-Shadows"><a href="#Dramatic-Drop-Shadows" class="headerlink" title="Dramatic Drop Shadows"></a>Dramatic Drop Shadows</h2><p>The story here is the same as that of the bevel. That Photoshop “Drop Shadow” layer style is just begging to be played with. If you start by tweaking the default effect, you’re likely to come up with something like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/ZbYrMf7.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>This shadow is big, soft, has plenty of distance and has a color that contrasts heavily with the background. Unfortunately, the result is a design that instantly reeks of cheesy fake lighting effects.</p>
<h3 id="Do-This-Instead-4"><a href="#Do-This-Instead-4" class="headerlink" title="Do This Instead"></a>Do This Instead</h3><p>There are still a million different popular ways to use drop shadows, the above example simply isn’t one of them. If you like the soft, feathered edge look, try blending the shadow in with the background so that it serves to make the text a tad more realistic without being a major distraction.</p>
<p><img src="http://img1.tuicool.com/aQFrimz.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>Another shadow treatment that’s popular right now harkens back to the days before it was common to use soft shadows. This effect uses a non-feathered drop shadow that has a little bit more of a retro feel.</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.tuicool.com/raQNVzU.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<p>You can take this a step further by layering the shadow with a knock section in between the shadow and the text. Once again, this is leaning towards a refined aged feel.</p>
<p><img src="http://img0.tuicool.com/zqiMJjA.jpg!web" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The examples above should serve to illustrate the idea that following antiquated trends can in fact have a negative effect on your designs and the impressions they leave on your viewers. Once again, the main principal I’m trying to communicate is<em>intentionality</em>. As long as you know what it is your design style of choice is communicating, and that concept or time period is exactly what you’re going for, then you’re on the right track.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that design trends wouldn’t evolve at all without pioneers that go against what’s currently popular and blaze their own trail. Don’t be too eager to jump onto the overused tricks bandwagon if you’re working on a project that merits some innovative thought. Go your own way and let everyone follow you!</p>

Or maybe it’s a book that<a href="https://www.amazon.com/But-What-If-Were-Wrong/dp/0399184139/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8" target="_blank" rel="external">rises above the rest</a>. A football star like Tom Brady, even at 39, is great because of who he is and his<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/feb/05/new-england-patriots-super-bowl-51-champions-atlanta-falcons" target="_blank" rel="external">accomplishments</a>.</p>
<p>When a company stands out, you know because there are certain traits and attributes you can identify, sometimes just by paying closer attention. They are widespread and hard to ignore, You can look for these signs by listening closely to what people say in a meeting or when they banter in the cafeteria or after work.</p>
<p>Here are the signs, in order of importance leading up to the most critical attribute:</p>
<h2 id="1-Everyone-is-having-fun"><a href="#1-Everyone-is-having-fun" class="headerlink" title="1. Everyone is having fun"></a>1. Everyone is having fun</h2><p>This is the ultimate entry-point for greatness. It starts here. It’s just fun to be around companies where everyone knows how to do all of the other things on my list below. You want to be there. You feel encouraged and motivated. It’s a great place to hang out, even after work or on weekends. Fun radiates out of the place, and it is that_allure_that attracts even more talented employees one after the other. Without a sense of fun and creativity, forget ever achieving any level of greatness. To be great, you have to be a beacon.</p>
<h2 id="2-No-one-is-pedantic"><a href="#2-No-one-is-pedantic" class="headerlink" title="2. No one is pedantic"></a>2. No one is pedantic</h2><p>Why am I using such a specific word here? How is it related to great companies? For 26 years, I’ve been involved in multiple organizations and volunteered at many different entities both small and large, and the one thing that seems to kill all progress and creativity is a lack of respect. The sure sign that respect is not common in a company culture is when everyone acts like they know everything. Sure, the mantra “be curious” is important. You can’t be_curious_and_pedantic_at the same time. When the company is filled with people who want to learn new things, it becomes a great place.</p>
<h2 id="3-Empathy-abounds"><a href="#3-Empathy-abounds" class="headerlink" title="3. Empathy abounds"></a>3. Empathy abounds</h2><p>Empathy is an ability to see another point-of-view. When everyone seems to have that ability, look out–that company is going to excel. It’s going to blow the roof off, in fact. We all need each other to help us grow, and empathy is an engine for that. I’m going to help you, you’re going to help me–that’s called<em>teamwork</em>. Sadly, empathy is not that common. Tied closely with that sense of pride and a know-it-all-attitude is a closed mentality that is more about self advancement. I’ve visited hundreds and hundreds of companies, and the one trait that seems to stick out when there’s a bad one is when everyone is trying to advance their own career. Empathy is in short supply, and so is greatness.</p>
<h2 id="4-Expectations-are-crystal-clear-to-everyone"><a href="#4-Expectations-are-crystal-clear-to-everyone" class="headerlink" title="4. Expectations are crystal clear to everyone"></a>4. Expectations are crystal clear to everyone</h2><p>Years ago, I had a boss who never bothered to explain what we were doing or why. Then, he became critical when we didn’t do what he wanted. Huh? Every employee was shooting in the dark with a pop gun. We didn’t know where to aim, when to shoot, or why we were even in the room. As humans, we all want to know<em>why</em>–what’s the vision here? Where are we even going? Why are we doing these things? If that’s crystal clear, then it creates a great company because the entire organization becomes unified. Even more importantly, the goals are clear to everyone involved. It’s not a well-kept secret.</p>
<h2 id="5-Grace-is-prevalent"><a href="#5-Grace-is-prevalent" class="headerlink" title="5. Grace is prevalent"></a>5. Grace is prevalent</h2><p>What happens when employees miss their goals? What if you know where you’re going as an organization but you don’t quite end up getting there in the end? This is where grace is important. I’m convinced that showing grace instead of a demeaning, belittling attitude is what makes a company even greater. I’ll say it’s even more important than having fun. Why is that? Because grace is a license to fail, and being free to try new things and fail at times is what makes people work hard and want to stick around. A culture of criticism kills momentum. A culture of grace, encouragement, understanding, and excitement will turn any organization into a<em>giant</em>.</p>
<h2 id="6-Roles-are-clearly-defined"><a href="#6-Roles-are-clearly-defined" class="headerlink" title="6. Roles are clearly defined"></a>6. Roles are clearly defined</h2><p>“I never know what I’m doing” is a tough predicament for any employee. Employees feel anxious and awkward. You have to set expectations about the<em>why</em>. However, even more important as a starting point for greatness is the idea of role definition. Employee need to feel empowered, and that’s where clear roles come into play. A role is a reason. It’s a way to define why that employee is even at the company and the scope of their involvement. You can’t make expectations until you have informed the employee about how much power he or she can wield. Then, set them loose. Greatness will happen.</p>
<h2 id="7-Everyone-sees-and-rewards-hard-work"><a href="#7-Everyone-sees-and-rewards-hard-work" class="headerlink" title="7. Everyone sees and rewards hard work"></a>7. Everyone sees and rewards hard work</h2><p>I’ve been involved with companies that really know how to recognize employees. On Slack, they’re praising each other all day–in a real way that shows true pride in the accomplishments of others. We communicated! We discussed! We resolved! It’s a team exercise writ large (and in digital form), one that involves frequent pats on the back when there’s a milestone. It’s crazy to think some companies don’t do this. They only acknowledge hard work in rare instances. Most of the time, they are treating employees like cattle that need to be herded–and kicked if they get out of line.</p>
<h2 id="8-Every-employee-is-happy"><a href="#8-Every-employee-is-happy" class="headerlink" title="8. Every employee is happy"></a>8. Every employee is happy</h2><p>Here’s a great way to define happiness at work: An employee is happy when they are perfectly suited to their role. They are challenged enough, placed into the proper department, encouraged constantly to achieve great things, and know their expectations. A happy group of employees creates a dynamic environment. An unhappy group causes constant conflict and stress, which makes the company sink like a stone.</p>
<h2 id="9-Mentoring-is-more-important-than-performance"><a href="#9-Mentoring-is-more-important-than-performance" class="headerlink" title="9. Mentoring is more important than performance"></a>9. Mentoring is more important than performance</h2><p>You know, most of us will figure it out and do great work. Beaten into submission by an angry boss won’t work. Mentoring will. I wanted to list this one as the most important attribute of a great company, but it does fall into second place. (Only a great leader can mentor effectively, so that has to be number one.) Yet, it’s so critical. It’s a way to hand down tacit knowledge. Great companies know how to do that. Great employees know how to mentor one another. They are highly motivated to train others because they know that’s what creates greatness. In fact, that’s really the definition to remember: A great company is one where the most important knowledge is handed down from one employee to the next in a way that’s built on the foundation of<em>individual relationships</em>.</p>
<h2 id="10-There’s-a-great-leader"><a href="#10-There’s-a-great-leader" class="headerlink" title="10. There’s a great leader"></a>10. There’s a great leader</h2><p>I’ve written about this before, but behind every great company there is a great leader. Call it the trickle-down effect of management. Someone at the top practices all of the attributes listed above and demonstrates what it means to show empathy, recognize hard work, and promote mentoring. Greatness happens. A great leader has an attitude that generates enthusiasm and happiness among the staff. It’s contagious.</p>

We are aware that the listed<a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/vpn/best-gaming-vpn/" target="_blank" rel="external">games</a>were supported on both iOS and Android. In fact, we have yet to come across<a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/android/best-shooter-games-for-android/" target="_blank" rel="external">Android</a>exclusive titles. So that opens a discussion about all the games that have come out on iOS that are playable offline. However, we recommend you check out our Android list after you’re done with this, it lists exceptional offline<a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/android/the-best-android-games-of-2017/" target="_blank" rel="external">games</a>that came out on iOS first and are definitely worth checking out.

<p>If you remember the choose your own adventure genre of books, Device 6 will seem familiar to you. Since page turning on a tablet is purely an affectation, the multiple award winning (including the coveted Apple Design Award) Device 6 takes it to the next conclusion. The game is a story about solving puzzles and finding your way through a series of choices. Some of those choices will lead to dead-ends and some of those choices will make the story progress.</p>
<p>Each new arc will either ask you to change your device’s orientation to read further, or will require you to scroll back to pick up sounds or other clues. There are no loading screens, no need for saves, it is a linear game with branching arcs. This is a must have for all iOS owners, even if they are not gamers, because it is a first of its kind genre defining game.</p>

<p>This is the game that took Telltale series form an obscure developer to a mainstream medium for title crossovers. Even though their preliminary focus remains on comic and fantasy crossovers today, their biggest foray was bringing back Monkey Island for the modern generation. The episodic concept was not even mainstream at the time. Telltale told the story of Guybrush Threepwood attempting to save himself from becoming a Zombie while protecting his wife Elaine Marley from the zombie pirate LeChuck. The last sequel of this series came out in the year 2000. If you are not familiar with the property, it is a comedy game (and a hilarious one at that) that focuses on puzzle solving to get through. Highly recommended.</p>

<p>This is one of those Tim Shafer strokes of genius. It originally came out on DOS back in 1993 as a sequel to Maniac Mansion that came out in 1987. In fact, you can even play the original game on an old computer. The remastered edition has breathed new life into what was already a timeless classic. The game is a comedy about a sentient tentacle who drinks radioactive water and becomes evil. Our main characters are a loony scientist who created the tentacle and three kids who end up in different eras in time.</p>
<p>You meet the founding fathers of the United States and you are thrust into a totalitarian future where the tentacles rule and humans are treated as pets. Day of The Tentacle is about restoring the timeline and order in the world. Every single puzzle is intriguing, the story is both engrossing and funny, and it is an experience every gamer needs to have at least once in their lives.</p>

<p>This first person adventure game comes from Simogo AB, the people behind Device 6. The game takes the Swedish lore of timewalking and turns it into the core mechanic. Set in the 19th century, the game relies on you to solve puzzles by touching them and seeing a glimpse of the future. The storyline is very immersive and you will be lost in all the creepy detail and atmosphere. The game, much like Device 6, is a bold step that seems to have paid off. It is a fantastic looking game that is both fun to play and immersive to experience.</p>

<p>The success of Minecraft is extraordinary. With a constantly expanding canvas that has now grown larger in size than the planet Neptune, it attracts players from all over the world to build structures out of blocks. If you are not familiar with the property, it is like playing with LEGOs on a computer, with the caveat that you never run out of blocks and you can do practically anything you want. People have recreated entire cities accurately scaled to the last detail, people have created bots (called engineers) to help create large structures for them. Even companies like Verizon have created cell networks within the game, where you can browse the internet and even make video calls (which is a feat of computer engineering on its own, check that out<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdlZRhKmWJY&amp;ab_channel=CaptainSparklez" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>).</p>
<p>If you are interested in creating objects, then this THE game for you. The pocket edition lets you play the game using the touchscreen and gives you the same access as any other platform.</p>

<p>This game originally came out in 1999 and has become a signature series since. Originally it was published by 3DO, now by Ubisoft (They’re up to the VII installment now). It is a turn based strategy game that puts you in the fictional world of fantasy creatures. You choose between mythical factions to strategically wage war against others. An army sent from the divine heavens could be put to fight against the armies of hell. Or you could pit orcs and goblins against elves and dragons. Genies vs Vampires, the list goes on.</p>

<p>The game is a turn-based strategy game. You send a hero out into the world to explore, fight creatures, unearth hidden and protected treasures, and defeat other heroes to become the last player standing. There is a fantastic story mode that takes you to all the realms in the game and a hot seat multiplayer mode that lets as many as 8 players take turns on the same machine. The HD remake keeps all the elements of the original release, only with updated visuals. The original game is played completely using a mouse pointer, which makes touch the ideal evolutionary platform for it.</p>

<p>You are a prisoner in a maximum security facility. Your mission is to escape. You do so by first learning the prison routine. You then craft items that will eventually help you find your way out of the prison. The concept is very simple, yet also very intriguing. It borrows numerous parts of different games like Minecraft and stealth games and combines them to help you escape from the confines of prison.</p>

<p>The LEGO series of games is a widespread genre from simple construction games to complex storylines with mainstream characters. There are crossovers from DC, Marvel, Star Wars, Harry Potter, and numerous others. The games bring a new light to already established properties. There is a fantastic storyline exclusive to the LEGO World. You can replay your favourite moments from franchises like Harry Potter and Star Wars with a LEGO twist, you can patrol Metropolis as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman or Green Lantern, it’s all possible. On top of all that, the games are genuinely fun without being silly. There is campy humor sprinkled here and there, but the games themselves are very true to the source material.</p>

Oceanhorn – Monster of Uncharted Seas</h3><p>Oceanhorn, by the developer’s own admission, is the iOS equivalent of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild the insanely popular title by Nintendo making the rounds on Nintendo Switch and Wii devices. However, Oceanhorn isn’t a cheap attempt at capitalizing on another title’s success, it is thematically close to The Wind Walker.</p>
<p>It is a beautifully crafted game with extremely stunning visuals that truly milk the GPU in your iOS device (especially the iPhone 7/7 Plus). The story is well crafted, the sound is well designed. It is actually a good game on its own merits and should definitely be tried out especially if you are a fan of the Zelda games.</p>

<p>This game will remind of you Lara Craft Go at first glance, because of the eerily similar visuals. However, if you treat it as a standalone title, you will be pleasantly surprised at just how good this game is. The game focuses on both visuals and some interesting puzzles to solve. Games like these are fun to play, as they can be played any time without requiring too much attention while still being entertaining.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Mac App Store and the iTunes App Store both ask for your password when you download an app. You will be asked to enter your Apple ID password regardless if you’re buying an app or downloading a free one. This is done in part to prevent unauthorized purchases. It’s also a good deterrent for when the kids go wild on the App Store. The only problem is that it can get annoying. If you don’t want to enter your password for free app downloads, you can save it. Likewise, if you’re regretting this decision, you can remove your Apple ID password for free purchases. Here’s how you can store or remove your Apple ID password for free purchases in macOS.</p>
<h3 id="Store-Apple-ID-Password-For-Free-Purchases"><a href="#Store-Apple-ID-Password-For-Free-Purchases" class="headerlink" title="Store Apple ID Password For Free Purchases"></a>Store Apple ID Password For Free Purchases</h3><p>There are two ways to go about this. One, open the Mac App Store app and look for a free app. Click the ‘Get’ button and enter your Apple ID password when prompted.</p>
<p>The Mac App Store app will prompt you to save your password for future free purchases. It’s very much like your browser asking to store login credentials for a website.</p>
<p>When you see the ‘Save Password for Free Items’ prompt, click ‘Yes’.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/mac-os/apple-id-password-for-free-purchases-macos/attachment/app-store-macos-password/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://cloud.addictivetips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/app-store-macos-password.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>If the prompt doesn’t appear, you can use the second method.</p>
<p>Open the System Preferences app. Click the App Store preference. At the very bottom is an option called ‘Free Downloads’. Open the drop-down next to it and select ‘Save Password’. macOS might prompt you to enter your Apple ID password. This will not affect paid app downloads. You will still be asked to enter your password when you buy an app.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/mac-os/apple-id-password-for-free-purchases-macos/attachment/system-preferences-for-macos/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://cloud.addictivetips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/system-preferences-for-macos.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<h3 id="Remove-Apple-ID-Password-For-Free-Purchases"><a href="#Remove-Apple-ID-Password-For-Free-Purchases" class="headerlink" title="Remove Apple ID Password For Free Purchases"></a>Remove Apple ID Password For Free Purchases</h3><p>Open System Preferences and select ‘App Store’. At the bottom of this preference pane open the Free Downloads drop-down. Select the ‘Require Password’ option. The next time you download a free app from the Mac App Store, you will have to enter you Apple ID password.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/mac-os/apple-id-password-for-free-purchases-macos/attachment/remove-app-store-password-for-free-apps/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://cloud.addictivetips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/remove-app-store-password-for-free-apps.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>This option has its pros and cons. The pro here is that you don’t need to verify your identity when you download a free app. A free app, by and large, will not create a problem for you. The con is that even free apps can be problematic in terms of content. If you don’t want to save your Apple ID password for free apps to protect minors who might use your Mac, consider using parental controls instead of removing your Apple ID password.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple released macOS Sierra in 2016 and the major feature in this version was the inclusion of Siri on the desktop. Plenty of other smaller features were also part of the update but Siri on the desktop was something people had been anticipating for quite some time. Another major update from Apple came in the form of the new Macbooks which have a new hardware component called the Touch Bar. It has mixed reviews but developers have been hard a work adding support for the Touch Bar. Here are the 10 best macOS apps and tips of 2016.</p>
<h2 id="Stream-Audio-From-Your-Mac-To-Chromecast"><a href="#Stream-Audio-From-Your-Mac-To-Chromecast" class="headerlink" title="Stream Audio From Your Mac To Chromecast"></a><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-stream-audio-from-your-pc-or-mac-to-chromecast/" target="_blank" rel="external">Stream Audio From Your Mac To Chromecast</a></h2><p>Chromecast is a pretty popular device with both macOS and Windows users. If you have a Chromecast that you’d like to use to cast just audio, there’s a little app that lets you do just that.</p>

It’s best to stay safe and you can start by keeping an eye on your webcam and mic. Oversight is a little app that can tell you which apps are accessing these two devices.</p>

Spotify, while not the same kind of service, has similar search parameters for refining your music search. If you’re interested in finding music from a particular genre or label, there are parameters you can apply to do just that.</p>

This is great because it lets you revert to the original photo whenever you want. It’s not so great when you want to move the edited version of the photo to your desktop. You just can’t copy the edited version and will always have the original photo. Here’s how to circumvent that.</p>

You need an iPhone and QuickTime Player.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google Assistant is Google’s answer to Siri, or Cortana. Google Assistant is the company’s attempt at a virtual assistant app. Unlike Apple though, Google isn’t restricting it to just Android. There’s already a Google Assistant iOS app which is limited compared to its Android counterpart but it’s there. You won’t see a Siri app for Android any time soon. While Google has made the Google Assistant app available on iOS of its own volition, it hasn’t released a desktop app for it. This is why you can’t get Google Assistant on macOS or Windows the same way you can get Siri and Cortana respectively.</p>
<p>The good news is, the developer community is on it.<strong>MacAssistant</strong>is a free open-source Mac app that lets you use Google Assistant on macOS. The app is still in beta but it works reasonably well.</p>
<p>Download MacAssistant. The developer isn’t verified so if you’re running the latest version of macOS, you won’t be able to run the app by just double-clicking it. Instead, open it Finder. Hold down the Ctrl key and then click the app. Select ‘Open’ from the context menu and the app will open.</p>

<p>MacAssistant runs from the Menu bar. Click the app icon in the Menu bar and sign in to your Google account.</p>

<p>The answer to whatever you ask Google Assistant is spoken back to you. There’s no UI for it just now. If you have the volume turned down, you won’t be able to use MacAssistant in its present form.</p>
<p>Like the earlier versions of Google Assistant, MacAssistant works only with voice input. Unlike the app on Android which now lets you<a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/android/input-text-in-google-assistant/" target="_blank" rel="external">input text in Google Assistant</a>, MacAssistant works only with voice commands. The app is still in its infancy so while we may have a wishlist of features, it’s not really fair to bring it up considering the app’s only been around for a week. It’s in active development so you can expect it to improve exponentially.</p>

    <title>How To Open Recently Quit Apps On macOS</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On macOS, closing an app and quitting it are two different things. When you close an app, you close all its windows. When you quit an app, you exit it. The difference is a closed app is technically still running. If you open it again, it will open much faster. Some apps don’t differentiate between closing and quitting. If you close an app, you effectively quit it at the same time.<strong>App Be Back</strong>is a free macOS app that lets you open recently quit apps via a keyboard shortcut. If you recently quit multiple apps, you can re-open them all again in reverse order. App Be Back is like the undo-close for recently closed tabs in your browse, except it works for apps.</p>
<p>Download and run App Be Back. You can undo-quit or open recently quit apps on macOS for all apps you quit after running App Be Back. If you quit an app when App Be Back wasn’t running, it will not be able to re-open it. The app works via a keyboard shortcut, and its menu bar icon.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/mac-os/open-recently-quit-apps/attachment/app-be-back/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://cloud.addictivetips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/app-be-back.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>To open recently quit apps, simply tap the Shift+Command+W keyboard shortcut. This will open the<a href="https://www.addictivetips.com/mac-os/how-to-switch-between-recent-apps-using-the-touch-bar-in-macos/" target="_blank" rel="external">recent app</a>you just quit. If you tap the shortcut again, it will open the app you quit before that last app.</p>

<p>For example, if you quit Safari, Photos, and Calendar in that order, the first time you tap the Shift+Command+W shortcut, it will open the Calendar app. If you tap it a second time, it will open Photos. Tapping it a third time will open Safari.</p>

<p>You can set App Be Back to open at login. You can also customize its shortcut to anything you like. To customize the app’s shortcut, and clear its history, click the app icon in the menu bar.</p>
<p>From the app menu, select ‘Change Keyboard Shortcut’ to record your own shortcut for the app. Select ‘Clear History’ to clear the history of recently closed apps. If you want to set it so that App Be Back runs at login, select ‘Show Intro’ from the app’s menu bar menu. The intro screen has a launch at login option.</p>

<p>App Be Back is a pretty neat app to have running. The only thing missing is perhaps an option to hide the app’s menu bar icon. It works perfectly well with just the keyboard shortcut and the menu bar icon is seldom needed. You might need it to change the app’s keyboard shortcut but that’s not a recurring need.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Learn todesign for the future, while balancing your design with your users’ present stage of skills andmindset. This is called theMAYA Principle and it’s the secret behind theindustrial design of the Coca-Cola bottle, Shell Oil logo, and the Greyhound logo.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.interaction-design.org/images/ux-daily/d2297af38d2226cd956a17baa2d08893.jpg" alt="">Author/Copyright holder: Raymond Loewy. Copyright terms and licence: All rights reserved</p>
<p>Designs and drawings by Raymond Loewy who designed the Air Force One logo, the Coca-Cola bottle, the Shell Oil logo, the US Postal Service logo, and the Greyhound logo.</p>
<p>Why not learn from the best design experts with the most impressive track record? Raymond Loewy (1893-1986) is often referred to as the father of Industrial Design and his track record is indeed impressive. The Air Force One logo, the Coca-Cola bottle, the Shell Oil logo, the US Postal Service logo, the Greyhound logo are just some of his impressive designs which still exist today.</p>
<p>Today, Loewy can still teach us to design our products with just the rightbalance between the well-known present, on onehand, and a new and innovative future on the other hand. If we don’t hit the right balance, our users won’t embrace nor buy our products, Loewy emphasized.</p>
<h2 id="The-MAYA-Principle"><a href="#The-MAYA-Principle" class="headerlink" title="The MAYA Principle"></a>The MAYA Principle</h2><p>Loewy’s secret was essential to design for the future – but delivering the future gradually. He designed his famous logos, some of the most recognizable cars of the 40s, 50s, and 60s, refrigerators, and locomotives for his users’ present needs and skills while pushing the boundaries of design and technology beyond his users’expectations. He called this approach the MAYA principle. Maya is an abbreviation for“<strong>Most Advanced. Yet Acceptable.</strong>” which means that Loewy sought to give his users the most advanced design, but not more advanced than what they were able to accept and embrace. Loewy believed that:</p>
<p>“The adult public’s taste is not necessarily ready to accept the logical solutions to their requirements if the solution implies too vast a departure from what they have been conditioned into accepting as the norm.”</p>

<p>The early iPod is a good example of how Apple applied the MAYA principle. The iPod’s designers gradually pushed theproduct design further and further as the iPod gradually lost the extra buttons and got a more streamlined interface. It is very likely that this gradual development from the first iPod in 2001 was what made the iPhone acceptable to users when it was launched in 2007. By applying the MAYA principle, the designers at Apple provided the users with the most advanced design within the boundaries of their acceptance.</p>

<p>The Newton tablet was an early personal digital assistant and the first tablet platform developed by Apple. Apple started developing the tablet in 1987. It was launched in 1993 and cancelled in 1998 as it was a financial disaster for Apple. There were several reasons that the Newton tablet did not become a success, but one of the main reasons could well be that the Newton tablet was introduced without users being familiar with a digital personal assistant.</p>
<p>A more recent example is Google Glass which has not become the success it was anticipated to become. Maybe it’s because the whole concept of wearing glasses that both record everything we do – while augmenting what we see with a layer of information – is simply too advanced for us. Maybe we need to take gradual steps before being ready to embrace this new technology. So the question is, how do we learn to strike the right balance between the most advanced design and our users’ ability to accept our product?</p>

<p>The lack of success for both Apple’s Newton tablet and Google Glass could be that they were too advanced for their users.</p>

Maybe the design solution was too advanced? Or too much like the old design? Next time, you should consider using the MAYA principle to strike the right balance.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advance your design gradually over time</strong><br>as the Apple designers did with their development of the iPod. Do not make a lot of major changes right away as you risk scaring off your users. You need to ask yourself what context your users are familiar with and which features has to be changed. When in doubt you should distinguish between: Nice to have and need to have.</li>
<li><strong>Include familiar patterns in the visual design</strong><br>so users can orient themselves just like Apple’s designers gradually made the iPod more and more streamlined and eventually launched the ultra-streamlined iPhone.</li>
<li><strong>Draw on your user’s present skills and mindset</strong><br>while presenting them with only a carefully chosen few major changes.</li>
<li>A golden rule is that<br><strong>if you have to explain your product design</strong><br>and if you need to include a manual or elaborate “help” features, your product is overly advanced or too complex to use. Your users should be able to understand and use your product instantly or at least with little training and explanation. Your users will lose confidence in the product and in themselves if they need to read a thick manual to understand it. We will explain how to find the right balance further down based on the theory of psychologist Lev Vygotsky.</li>
<li><p>The MAYA principle resonates with many design principles and heuristics such as the “<br>Match between the system and the real world” from Jakob Nielsen’s list of heuristics (</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heur…</a><br><strong>).</strong></p>
</li>
<li>The MAYA principle<br>also resonates with the use of libraries and design patterns when designing interactions: By using standard libraries and design patterns, you can increase the level of familiarity that the users will have with your design. That can be helpful if you aim to push the boundaries in some aspects of your design, i.e. if you intentionally depart from the norm in some aspects of your design.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Psychological-and-Philosophical-Perspectives-by-Vygotsky-and-Kierkegaard"><a href="#Psychological-and-Philosophical-Perspectives-by-Vygotsky-and-Kierkegaard" class="headerlink" title="Psychological and Philosophical Perspectives by Vygotsky and Kierkegaard"></a>Psychological and Philosophical Perspectives by Vygotsky and Kierkegaard</h2><p>“Most Acceptable, Yet Advanced” is not specific to design. It’s fundamental to how human beings learn new skills and insights.</p>
<p>Among educators, the Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard (1813-1855) is often quoted for emphasizing the fact that when you want to help someone learn a new skill (or product), you first need to find out about the person’s present skill level. You need to find out what’s acceptable to them before teaching them anything new and advanced. Otherwise your efforts (and your design of a new product) will not be worth anything. For instance, there is no reason to teach a child to spell the word “philosophical” if the child has not learned what an alphabet is and what it means. The first step is always to find out what is “acceptable” for the learner and user.</p>

<p>There’s no need to teach a child to spell the word “philosophical” if the child has not learned what an alphabet is and what it means. The first step is always to find out what is “acceptable” for the learner and user.</p>
<p>How advanced and innovative can you then make your new product or design? To answer that question, you can use the principle called the<strong>zone of proximal development (ZPD).</strong>The term was developed by the Soviet psychologist and founder of cultural-historical psychology, Lev Semyonovich Vygotsky (1896-1934).Vygotsky’s term zone of proximal development describes the range of skills that a child is in the process of learning.</p>
<p>Vygotsky stated that a child follows an adult’s example and gradually develops the ability to do certain tasks without help. Vygotsky believed that the role of education is to give children experiences that are within their zones of proximal development, thereby encouraging and advancing their individual learning.We will tell you how you can use that in a design process, but first you need some more background on the ZPD.</p>
<p>The lower limit of the ZPDis the maximum level of skill which a child can acquire by working independently (the child’s actual developmental level). This can be compared to your users’ present level of skills and the skills they are (easily) able to learn by themselves. This would mean small changes in an existing product, or a new product with a strong similarity to existing products or interaction patterns.</p>
<p>The upper limit of the ZPDis the maximum level of skills that the child is able to reach with the assistance of a more capable instructor. Vygotsky emphasized that you can only help the child, i.e. your user, through gradual steps of evolving new skills and understandings. A first-grade teacher will, of course, know that a child will learn to spell even the most complex words in the future. But you don’t present the child with long complex words to begin with. You start gradually by presenting the child with the letter A, then the letter B, and so forth. You always have to aim for only the next reachable zone of development.</p>
<p>What you can learn from Vygotsky is that you have to distinguish between:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your user’s lower limit of ZPD – i.e. what she can easily learn by herself, without your help, without a manual, or without an instructor’s help.</li>
<li>Your user’s upper limit of ZPD – i.e. what she can learn with the help of an instructor or manual.</li>
</ul>
<p>When seeking the right balance you should remember that a child most often has to attend school. Your users don’t have to buy your product. Maybe some users are forced to use your products at work, but you should strongly consider if you design for the lower or upper limit of ZPD. Do you want your users to read manuals or to require instruction before being able to use your product, or do you want them to be able to easily teach themselves new functions?</p>
<p>The MAYA principle advocates for designing with the lower limit of ZPD in mind if you want your product to succeed. Most often, users will not spend their valuable time and money by learning how to use your new product if they can find a product which is easier to use.At the same time, users are often attracted to shiny new products with advanced features - designed with the future in mind. Finding the right balance could be the determining factor that will decide if your next product will become a success.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Is the keyboard faster than the mouse?</strong></p>
<p>Which is faster, keyboard or mouse? A large number of programmers believe that the keyboard is faster for all (programming-related) tasks. However, there are a few widely cited webpages that claim that “studies” show that using the mouse is faster than using the keyboard for everything and that people who think that using the keyboard is faster are just deluding themselves. This might sound extreme, but, just for example, one page says that the author has “never seen [the keyboard] outperform the mouse”.</p>
<p>But it can’t be the case that the mouse is faster for everything – almost no one is faster at clicking on an on-screen keyboard with a mouse than typing at a physical keyboard. Conversely, there are tasks for which mice are much better suited than keyboards (e.g., aiming in FPS games). For someone without an agenda, the question shouldn’t be, which is faster at all tasks, but which tasks are faster with a keyboard, which are faster with a mouse, and which are faster when both are used?</p>
<p>To start, let’s look at the cited studies to see where the mouse is really faster. Most references on the web, when followed all the way back, point to the AskTog, a site by<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Tognazzini" target="_blank" rel="external">Bruce Tognazzini</a>, who describes himself as a “recognized leader in human/computer interaction design”.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.asktog.com/TOI/toi06KeyboardVMouse1.html" target="_blank" rel="external">The most cited AskTog page on the topic claims that they’ve spent $50M of R&amp;D and done all kinds of studies</a>; the page claims that, among other things, the $50M in R&amp;D showed “Test subjects consistently report that keyboarding is faster than mousing” and “The stopwatch consistently proves mousing is faster than keyboarding. ”. The claim is that this both proves that the mouse is faster than the keyboard, and explains why programmers think the keyboard is faster than the mouse even though it’s slower. However, the result unreproducible because “Tog” doesn’t not only doesn’t cite the details of the experiments, Tog doesn’t even describe the experiments and just makes a blanket claim.</p>
<p>The<a href="http://www.asktog.com/TOI/toi22KeyboardVMouse2.html" target="_blank" rel="external">second widely cited AskTog page</a>is in response to a response to the previous page, and it simply repeats that the first page showed that keyboard shortcuts are slower. While there’s a lot of sarcasm, like “Perhaps we have all been misled these years. Perhaps the independent studies that show over and over again that Macintosh users are more productive, can learn quicker, buy more software packages, etc., etc., etc., are somehow all flawed. Perhaps….” no actual results are cited, as before. There is, however, a psuedo-scientific explanation of why the mouse is faster than the keyboard:</p>
<p>Command Keys Aren’t Faster. As you know from my August column, it takes just as long to decide upon a command key as it does to access the mouse. The difference is that the command-key decision is a high-level cognitive function of which there is no long-term memory generated. Therefore, subjectively, keys seem faster when in fact they usually take just as long to use.</p>
<p>Since mouse acquisition is a low-level cognitive function, the user need not abandon cognitive process on the primary task during the acquisition period. Therefore, the mouse acquirer achieves greater productivity.</p>
<p>One question this raises is, why should typing on the keyboard be any different from using command keys? There certainly are people who aren’t fluent at touch typing who have to think about which key they’re going to press when they type. Those people are very slow typists, perhaps even slower than someone who’s quick at using the mouse to type via an on screen keyboard. But there are also people who are fluent with the keyboard and can type without consciously thinking about which keys they’re going to press. The implicit claim here is that it’s not possible to be fluent with command keys in the same way it’s possible to be fluent with the keyboard for typing. It’s possible that’s true, but I find the claim to be highly implausible, both in principle, and from having observed people who certainly seem to be fluent with command keys, and the claim has no supporting evidence.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.asktog.com/SunWorldColumns/S02KeyboardVMouse3.html" target="_blank" rel="external">The third widely cited AskTog page cites a single experiment</a>, where the author typed a paragraph and then had to replace every “e” with a “|”, either using cursor keys or the mouse. The author found that the average time for using cursor keys was 99.43 seconds and the average time for the mouse was 50.22 seconds. No information about the length of the paragraph or the number of “e”s was given. The third page was in response to a user who cited specific editing examples where they found that they were faster with a keyboard than with a mouse.</p>
<p>My experience with benchmarking is that the vast majority of microbenchmarks have wrong or misleading results because they’re difficult to set up properly, and even when set up properly, understanding how the microbenchmark results relate to real-world world results requires a deep understanding of the domain. As a result, I’m deeply skeptical of broad claims that come from microbenchmarks unless the author has a demonstrated, deep, understanding of benchmarking their particular domain, and even then I’ll ask why they believe their result generalizes. The opinion that microbenchmarks are very difficult to interpret properly is<a href="https://twitter.com/shipilev/status/709982588673388544" target="_blank" rel="external">widely shared among people who understand benchmarking</a>.</p>
<p>The<code>e -&gt; |</code>replacement task described is not only a microbenchmark, it’s a bizarrely artificial microbenchmark.</p>
<p>Based on the times given in the result, the task was either for very naive users, or disallowed any kind of search and replace functionality. This particular AskTog column is in response to a programmer who mentioned editing tasks, so the microbenchmark is meaningless unless that programmer is trapped in an experiment where they’re not allowed to use their editor’s basic functionality. Moreover, the replacement task itself is unrealistic – how often do people replace<code>e</code>with<code>|</code>?</p>
<p>I timed this task without the bizarre no-search-and-replace restriction removed and got the following results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keyboard shortcut: 1.26s</li>
<li>M-x, “replace-string” (instead of using mapped keyboard shortcut): 2.8s</li>
<li>Navigate to search and replace with mouse: 5.39s</li>
</ul>
<p>The first result was from using a keyboard shortcut. The second result is something I might do if I were in someone else’s emacs setup, which has different keyboard shortcuts mapped; emacs lets you run a command by hitting “M-x” and typing the entire name of the command. That’s much slower than using a keyboard shortcut directly, but still faster than using the mouse (at least for me, here) Does this mean that keyboards are great and mice are terrible? No, the result is nearly totally meaningless because I spend almost none of my time doing single-character search-and-replace, making the speed of single-character search-and-replace irrelevant.</p>
<p>Also, since I’m used to using the keyboard, the mouse speed here is probably unusually slow. That’s doubly true here because my normal editor setup (<code>emacs -nw</code>) doesn’t allow for mouse usage, so I ended up using an unfamiliar editor,<code>TextEdit</code>, for the mouse test. I did each task once in order to avoid “practicing” the exact task, which could unrealistically make the keyboard-shortcut version nearly instantaneous because it’s easy to hit a practiced sequence of keys very quickly. However, this meant that I was using an unfamiliar mouse in an unfamiliar set of menus for the mouse. Furthermore, like many people who’ve played FPS games in the distant past, I’m used to having “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=mouse+acceleration" target="_blank" rel="external">mouse acceleration</a>” turned off, but the Mac has this on by default and I didn’t go through the rigmarole necessary to disable mouse acceleration. Additionally, recording program I used (quicktime) made the entire machine laggy, which probably affects mousing speed more than keyboard speed, and the menu setup for the program I happened to use forced me to navigate through two levels of menus.</p>
<p>That being said, despite not being used to the mouse, if I want to find a microbenchmark where I’m faster with the mouse than with the keyboard, that’s easy: let me try selecting a block of text that’s on the screen but not near my cursor:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keyboard: 1.8s</li>
<li>Mouse: 0.7s</li>
</ul>
<p>I tend to do selection of blocks in emacs by searching for something at the start of the block, setting a mark, and then searching for something at the end of the mark. I typically type three characters to make sure that I get a unique chunk of text (and I’ll type more if it’s text where I don’t think three characters will cut it). This makes the selection task somewhat slower than the replacement task because the replacement task used single characters and this task used multiple characters.</p>
<p>The mouse is so much better suited for selecting a block of text that even with an unfamiliar mouse setup where I end up having to make a correction instead of being able to do the selection in one motion, the mouse is over twice as fast. But, if I wanted select something that was off screen and the selection was so large that it wouldn’t fit on one screen, the keyboard time wouldn’t change and the mouse time would get much slower, making the keyboard faster.</p>
<p>In addition to doing the measurements, I also (informally) polled people to ask if they thought the keyboard or the mouse would be faster for specific tasks. Both search-and-replace and select-text are tasks where the result was obvious to most people. But not all tasks are obvious; scrolling was one where people didn’t have strong opinions one way or another. Let’s look at scrolling, which is a task both the keyboard and the mouse are well suited for. To have something concrete, let’s look at scrolling down 4 pages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keyboard: 0.49s</li>
<li>Mouse: 0.57s</li>
</ul>
<p>While there’s some difference, and I suspect that if I repeated the experiment enough times I could get a statistically significant result, but the difference is small enough that the difference isn’t of practical significance.</p>
<p>Contra Tog’s result, which was that everyone believes the keyboard was faster even though the mouse is faster, I find that people are pretty good at estimating what’s which device is faster for which tasks and also at estimate when both devices will give a similar result. One possible reason is that I’m polling programmers, and in particular, programmers at<a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=b504af89e87b77920c9b60b2a1f6d5e8" target="_blank" rel="external">RC</a>, who are probably a different population than whoever Tog might’ve studied in his studies. He was in a group that was looking at how to design the UI for a general purpose computer in the 80s, where it would have been actually been unreasonable to focus on studying people, many of whom grew up using computers, and then chose a career where you use computers all day. The equivalent population would’ve had to start using computers in the 60s or even earlier, but even if they had, input devices were quite different (the ball mouse wasn’t invented until 1972, and it certainly wasn’t in wide use the moment it was invented). There’s nothing wrong with studying populations who aren’t relatively expert at using computer input devices, but there is something wrong with generalizing those results to people who are relatively expert.</p>
<p>Unlike claims by either keyboard or mouse advocates, when I do experiments myself, the results are mixed. Some tasks are substantially faster if I use the keyboard and some are substantially faster if I use the mouse. Moreover, most of the results are easily predictable (when the results are similar, the prediction is that it would be hard to predict). If we look at the most widely cited, authoritative, results on the web, we find that they make very strong claims that the mouse is much faster than the keyboard but back up the claim with nothing but a single, bogus, experiment. It’s possible that some of the vaunted $50M in R&amp;D went into valid experiments, but those experiments, if they exist, aren’t cited.</p>
<p>I spent some time reviewing the literature on the subject, but couldn’t find anything conclusive. Rather than do a point-by-point summary of each study (<a href="https://danluu.com/empirical-pl/" target="_blank" rel="external">like I did here for here for another controversial topic</a>), I’ll mention the high-level issues that make the studies irrelevant to me. All studies I could find had at least one of the issues listed below; if you have a link to a study that isn’t irrelevant for one of the following reasons, I’d love to hear about it!</p>
<ol>
<li>Age of study: it’s unclear how a study on interacting with computers from the mid-80s transfers to how people interact with computers today. Even ignoring differences in editing programs, there are large differences in the interface. Mice are more precise and a decent modern optical mouse can be moved as fast as a human can move it without the tracking becoming erratic, something that isn’t true of any mouse I’ve tried from the 80s and was only true of high quality mice from the 90s when the balls were recently cleaned and the mouse was on a decent quality mousepad. Keyboards haven’t improved as much, but even so, I can type substantially faster a modern, low-travel, keyboard than on any keyboard I’ve tried from the 80s.</li>
<li>Narrow microbenchmarking: not all of these are as irrelevant as the<br><code>e -</code><br><code>&gt;</code><br><code>|</code><br>without search and replace task, but even in the case of tasks that aren’t obviously irrelevant, it’s not clear what the impact of the result is on actual work I might do.</li>
<li>Not keyboard vs. mouse: a tiny fraction of published studies are on keyboard vs. mouse interaction. When a study is on device interaction, it’s often about some new kind of device or a new interaction model.</li>
<li>Vague description: a lot of studies will say something like they found a 7.8% improvement, with results being significant with p<br>&lt;<br> 0.005, without providing enough information to tell if the results are actually significant or merely statistically significant (recall that the practically insignificant scrolling result was a 0.08s difference, which could also be reported as a 16.3% improvement).</li>
<li>Unskilled users: in one, typical, paper, they note that it can take users as long as two seconds to move the mouse from one side of the screen to a scrollbar on the other side of the screen. While there’s something to be said for doing studies on unskilled users in order to figure out what sorts of interfaces are easiest for users who have the hardest time, a study on users who take 2 seconds to get their mouse onto the scrollbar doesn’t appear to be relevant to my user experience. When I timed this for myself, it took 0.21s to get to the scrollbar from the other side of the screen and scroll a short distance, despite using an unfamiliar mouse with different sensitivity than I’m used to and running a recording program which made mousing more difficult than usual.</li>
<li>Seemingly unreasonable results: some studies claim to show large improvements in overall productivity when switching from type of device to another (e.g., a 20% total productivity gain from switching types of mice).</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>It’s entirely possible that the mysterious studies Tog’s org spent $50M on prove that the mouse is faster than the keyboard for all tasks other than raw text input, but there doesn’t appear to be enough information to tell what the actual studies were. There are many public studies on user input, but I couldn’t find any that are relevant to whether or not I should use the mouse more or less at the margin.</p>
<p>When I look at various tasks myself, the results are mixed, and they’re mixed in the way that most programmers I polled predicted. This result is so boring that it wouldn’t be worth mentioning if not for the large groups of people who believe that either the keyboard is always faster than the mouse or vice versa.</p>
<p>Please let me know if there are relevant studies on this topic that I should read! I’m not familiar with the relevant fields, so it’s possible that I’m searching with the wrong keywords and reading the wrong papers.</p>
